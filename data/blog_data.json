    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 12, 2024 What's new in imagery in ArcGIS Online (November 2024) By Jeff Swain and Ling Tang and Sarmistha Chatterjee Imagery can be hosted, visualized, analyzed, and shared in ArcGIS Online, which assists organizations in managing and sharing their imagery data without the need for infrastructure. Once you have all your imagery data organized, ArcGIS Online allows for analysis workflows, including deep learning. For this release, there are several upgrades to the user experience for raster analysis in Map Viewer, including: Adding multi tab viewing for raster function editor to switch between several raster function templates. Improved display of the multidimensional slider to remain visible when the raster function editor is enabled Enhancements for raster functions Adding the Geographic transformation environment setting to allow control over the transformation Raster Function Templates in ArcGIS Living Atlas Multi tab viewing raster function templates The Raster function editor has been enhanced to allow multiple raster function templates to be opened and stored as tabs in the Raster function editor. You can switch between the different raster function templates to make any edits. You can add raster function templates that you have created before or add new raster function templates from the Raster Function Templates pane in Map Viewer. Multidimensional slider visibility The Multidimensional slider will remain visible and on top of the Raster Function Editor when it is open to allow you to display the multidimensional imagery layer as desired. Previously the Multidimensional slider would remain fixed at the bottom of the map, which may make it difficult to determine which slice is being displayed. With this update, the multidimensional slider will be visible on top of the Raster Function Editor when it is open. The Time slider will also reposition on top of the Raster Function Editor. Enhancements for raster functions Distance Accumulation and Distance Allocation raster functions have two new options for the Vertical factor parameter: Hiking time and Bidirectional hiking time. The performance of these tools has also been improved if the Distance method parameter value is Geodesic, or if the Vertical factor or Horizontal factor parameters are set. New Raster Analysis Environment setting: Geographic Transformations There are many different Environment settings available to customize raster analysis in Map Viewer. The latest addition to the other environment settings is the Geographic Transformations setting which allows you to specify transformation methods that can be used to project data during raster analysis. The environment settings can be customized for individual raster analysis tools or for the web map. Raster Function Templates in ArcGIS Living Atlas There have been two new raster function templates to use in your analysis, including: Monitoring Algae Bloom Concentration In Turbid Waterbodies \u2013 This raster function template uses the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) to monitor phytoplankton abundance in water. Create Cloud Free Image Composite with Landsat Level-2 \u2013 This raster function template is designed to create a cloud-free image composite using the Landsat Level-2 layer, which is accessible through the Living Atlas of the World.

    "title": "What's New in Oriented Imagery (November 2024): 360 images",
    "date": "2024-11-08",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 08, 2024 What's New in Oriented Imagery (November 2024) By Emily Windahl There are so many new oriented imagery features this month! The oriented imagery capability of ArcGIS empowers you to turn all kinds of images into geospatial assets in your GIS: 360 images, street-level images, cell phone images, high oblique drone images, and more. Discover and explore full-resolution images in an intuitive viewing experience that combines multiple image perspectives with 3D, vector, and other geospatial data to improve human interpretation and generate new and unique insights from your GIS. New in ArcGIS Pro 3.4\u2014 Visualize 360-degree and panoramic images Use deep learning to detect objects in oriented imagery layers and project them onto a map Take advantage of an improved Add Images to Oriented Imagery Dataset geoprocessing tool And more! New in ArcGIS Online (November)\u2014 Project feature layers directly onto your imagery in the oriented imagery viewer Use Scene Viewer to publish a web scene with oriented imagery layers, then create a 3D oriented imagery web app with ArcGIS Instant Apps Read on to learn more! What\u2019s new in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 Take advantage of new oriented imagery features in Pro 3.4! Visualize 360-degree and panoramic images Expand the imagery modalities you can visualize in your desktop GIS to add insight and new perspectives, and improve your oriented imagery management workflow by visualizing your 360 and panoramic images in Pro before you publish your oriented imagery layer. The 3.4 release of ArcGIS Pro supports equirectangular 360 images stored as JPEGs (the most common format). In future releases, we\u2019ll expand 360 support to include stitched and unstitched cube maps, and to include tiled file formats like TIFF, COG, and MRF. Use AI to detect objects in an oriented imagery layer The Detect Objects Using Deep Learning geoprocessing tool now supports oriented imagery layers as input. The tool will detect objects in the images in image space, then use the oriented imagery image-to-ground logic to project the location of the objects onto the ground. In this release, the tool will work best for features on the ground (like fire hydrants). Enhancements to the Add Images to Oriented Imagery Dataset tool Adding images to an oriented imagery dataset from cloud storage is now significantly faster thanks to the advantages of parallel processing. Additionally, when you add images to an oriented imagery dataset, you can now use omega, phi, kappa to define orientation (the output orientation will be converted to heading, pitch, roll to align with the oriented imagery schema). We\u2019re also introducing new fields that users can use instead of the optional CameraOrientation field, allowing users to manage camera intrinsic parameters such as camera focal length, lens distortion and affine parameters as separate fields without creating a complex pipe-delimited string. Both options are still supported\u2014whether provided in the CameraOrientation field or using the new fields, these parameters support more accurate image-to-ground and ground-to-image transformations for better visualization. If the CameraOrientation field is present, those values will be used by default. Moving forward, though, we encourage users to use the new fields instead of the CameraOrientation field. Check out documentation on the input oriented imagery table to learn more. Leverage floor filters when you visualize an oriented imagery layer For users working with oriented imagery in the context of a floor-aware map, explore your imagery more intuitively\u2014the oriented imagery viewer now honors the level defined by the map floor filter when the floor level is defined for your images. If you\u2019re looking at features on the 2nd floor in your map, now you be sure all your oriented images are on the 2nd floor, too. Display the popup for the current image The \u201cShow pop-ups\u201d tool in the oriented imagery viewer displays the pop-up for the current image, allowing you to view the image and its attributes at the same time to better understand the image you\u2019re looking at. Visualize MRFs stored locally in Pro Previous releases of Pro could only visualize images stored as MRFs if they were in the cloud; now you can visualize these files in Pro when they\u2019re stored locally, simplifying storage considerations and streamlining image management workflows. What\u2019s new in ArcGIS Online Watch for new oriented imagery features in the November 2024 release of ArcGIS Online. Overlay feature layers in the oriented imagery viewer With feature overlays, you can now project feature layers directly into the oriented imagery viewer to better understand exactly how your vector data intersects with an image, adding context and understanding to both. Support for overlays in the oriented imagery viewer is available in Map Viewer, the ArcGIS Instant Apps Sidebar and 3D Viewer templates, and in the oriented imagery widget in the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Ja",
    "summary": "ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Online (November 2024) introduce several new features for oriented imagery, including support for visualizing 360-degree and panoramic images, using deep learning to detect objects in oriented imagery layers, enhancements to the Add Images to Oriented Imagery Dataset tool, and the ability to overlay feature layers in the oriented imagery viewer.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Data Reviewer (November 2024) By Sara Eddy and Jay Cary ArcGIS Data Reviewer is an extension to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Enterprise that automates, simplifies and improves data quality management workflows. The release of ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 introduces new automated review workflows for identifying poor-quality features, enhancements to data quality checks and improved support for visual review workflows. Read this blog for details on what\u2019s new in the ArcGIS Data Reviewer November 2024 release. Enhancements in automated review Interactive quality control A new workflow for automating the detection of poor-quality features is now available in ArcGIS Pro. This form of data quality control is easy to use and delivers results quickly. Different aspects of a feature\u2019s quality can be assessed and often in just a few mouse clicks. Data quality checks supporting this form of data review include the following: The Check Geometry check finds features that contain invalid geometries. The Cutbacks check finds polyline or polygon features that contain high-angle turns that cause features to turn back toward themselves. The Domain check finds features that contain attribute values that do not comply with domain constraints. The Duplicate Feature check finds features of the same geometry type that contain duplicate geometry and have matching attribute values. The Feature on Feature check finds features from the same or two different feature layers that share a spatial relationship and returns them as results. The Subtype check features with improper or null subtype values. The Table to Table Attribute check finds features or rows that contain attribute values that meet a relationship you define and compares them to values in another feature class or stand-alone table. The Query Attributes check finds features based on a query against its attribute values. Errors identified during check execution are saved as a layer in the map. The layer shows where the errors are located and other details about the error condition. Error results can assist in the following workflows: Testing a check\u2019s configuration before implementing it as an attribute rule. As a tabular report to aid in determining whether the data is suitable for use in a project. Giving feedback to editors to fix errors and improve data quality. Enhancements to automated checks There have been a series of enhancements to data quality checks that automate the validation of data in both attribute rule and interactive quality control workflows. These enhancements include the following: The Domain check has been enhanced to improve usability in corrective workflows by identifying only those fields which contain invalid attribute values. The Table to Table Attribute check has been enhanced to support the evaluation of a subset of features/rows from another feature class or stand-alone table when comparing a feature\u2019s attribution. The Invalid Event Measures, Find Event Gaps, Find Event Overlaps, and Find Orphan Events checks can now be used in file and mobile geodatabases to implement validation attribute rules that detect common errors in linear referenced events. New quick-start resources To help new users get familiar with services-based automated review, a new quick-start tutorial series is available to learn how to configure, deploy and use Data Reviewer-based attribute rules with ArcGIS Enterprise and ArcGIS Pro. Enhancements in semiautomated review Updates for visual review workflows ArcGIS Pro\u2019s Flag Missing Features tool supports visual review workflows that document missing features in data. This tool has been updated to improve efficiency and usability by enabling the creation of point, line or polygon sketches that identify specific geographies where there are missing features. ArcGIS Pro\u2019s Browse Features pane supports visual review workflows that document errors that may not be detected during automated review of data including the documentation of features that contain errors related to their shape or positional accuracy. The tool has been updated to improve efficiency and usability in the following ways: Automatically selecting and zooming to the extent of the currently selected feature. Supports the creation of point, line and polygon sketches to identify specific corrective actions required on a feature. Managing a dataset\u2019s participation in visual review workflows has also been simplified. The Data Reviewer property page can now be accessed from the Geodatabase properties dialog which allows management of all feature classes and tables in the geodatabase. From this new page, you can now enable a dataset\u2019s participation in visual review workflows and customize error messages that are available when identifying data errors with ArcGIS Pro\u2019s Flag Missing Features or Browse Features tools.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 14, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Drone2Map 2024.2 By Mark Barker The newest version of ArcGIS Drone2Map has been released and we\u2019re excited to share the latest features and enhancements. This blog contains just some of the highlights. For a complete list of everything new or improved please check out the help documentation. Processing Improvements 3D Point Clouds and 3D Mesh products have received a few improvements this release. Overall processing time to generate a 3D Point Cloud product has been reduced, and the quality of both 3D Point Clouds and 3D Meshes have improved. 3D Mesh products processed with high point cloud density will now include more detail on thin structure features, such as transmission towers, traffic poles, and fences. The detail for a 3D Mesh is also better preserved when zooming in and out of a scene. Control Point Improvements More flexibility has been added for importing control point photos and changing the accuracy of control points. It is now possible to import photos of control points after a project has been created through new tools on the home tab and control manager pane. Additionally, when working in the image links editor, you can add, replace, and delete control photos on a per control point basis. Control point accuracy can also be easily updated after a project has been created. This provides an easy way to update the horizontal and vertical accuracy of one or more control points. The image links editor has been enhanced based on some much-requested user feedback. When using estimated image links, you can now select and accept the image links individually instead of having to accept all the estimates, speeding up the linking process and reducing the chance of incorrect links. Improved navigation and image display options now make it easier to adjust various image settings and link control points within images on low resolution datasets such as thermal imagery. Measurement Enhancements Up until now, measurements within a Drone2Map project have been limited to features drawn within that project. With Drone2Map 2024.2 we have introduced the ability to import existing feature classes or measurement feature datasets. If you are frequently flying the same area and taking measurements or volume calculations the measurements from those projects can now be imported to help track change over time. Additionally, we have also added the ability to copy measurements. Any measurement you create within a project can be easily copied through a new button on the mensuration results pane. When copying the measurement, settings can also be modified so you can perform calculations from different elevation layers or base surfaces and compare results. Image Metadata Viewer Metadata drives the successful processing of drone data. To help troubleshoot the results of processing it is helpful to have access to the image metadata to make sure settings were configured properly. To help make this easier, a built-in, searchable image metadata viewer has been added. The image metadata viewer presents all your images in a table alongside the metadata and a preview of the currently selected image. When you click an image within the table, the metadata viewer will update and show all the relevant metadata for the selected image.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog 3D Visualization & Analytics Nov 07, 2024 What's New in Scene Viewer for Enterprise (November 2024) By Jasmine Du We are thrilled to introduce our latest release of Scene Viewer for ArcGIS Enterprise, packed with features and enhancements designed to elevate your 3D web experience. This update brings transformative features that will improve 3D workflows for users across different industries. Unveil the 4th dimension of GIS with Time Time, the 4th dimension of data, enables you to visualize data across temporal scales, offering a dynamic and comprehensive view of your information. This release introduces two powerful features to help you incorporate the 4th dimension into Scene Viewer with ease. Time Slider Support With the new time slider, you can seamlessly explore and visualize time-enabled data. Besides the existing 2D layers with time, we also support time-enabled point, 3D object, and voxel scene layers now. You have full control over the animation, with options to play, pause, and navigate between previous and next time periods. Time information can also be persisted in slides. You can either store specific points in time within a slide for quick access or save your scene and load it into other applications, such as StoryMaps, with the same time period displayed. Customize Time Periods for Each Layer We always had time support on a feature basis, where individual features show or hide based on time. We are now introducing time on a layer basis, where whole layers show or hide based on time. After signing into Scene Viewer, you can define a period for layer visibility in Layer Properties. This feature allows you to combine different datasets into one continuous story across time. This can make a lot of sense for data where each update is stored in a new layer. For example, in a construction project, you can now visualize drone imagery of a construction site or compare imagery before and after a natural event like a landslide, providing you with deeper insights and improved project management. New content in 3D context Scene Viewer is the foundational application that empowers you to integrate all kinds of data into a single, dynamic Web Scene. Our mission is to revolutionize your 3D context by enriching it with diverse datasets that elevate and streamline your workflow. 3D Model Upload Out of Beta with Enhanced Editing Accuracy We are delighted to announce that the ability to upload your own 3D models is now officially out of beta! With the editable 3D object scene layer, users can seamlessly upload 3D models into the web environment. This feature serves as an entry point for effortlessly integrating 3D models of various formats into the geospatial context. We have made enhancements to improve stability and ease of use, including a new feature that allows for coordinate input during editing, significantly enhancing accuracy. Support Catalog Layer Managing extensive collections of layers from different sources can be challenging. That\u2019s why we introduced the Catalog Layer ,which acts as a collection of item references to layers and services. A well-maintained catalog dataset, coordinated across single or multiple organizations, allows you to quickly discover and explore content and view visual changes over a given time, range, or other attributes. Support Media Layer The Media Layer enables the addition of image to the 3D scene at specified geographic locations. This layer is perfect for displaying a variety of content, including old scanned maps, weather data, satellite imagery, aerial and drone images. You can begin digitizing features or upload a 3D model into your scene using the existing Media Layer as the starting point for your editing workflows. By incorporating the Media Layer into Scene Viewer, you can bring these contents to life in a creative and immersive 3D environment. Note: Existing Media Layer can be added to Scene Viewer. Follow this blog to learn more about how to create Media Layer with Map Viewer. Enhanced 3D visualization Position Your Data at the Right Elevation In this release, we have introduced the ability to customize the elevation mode to precisely position your layers. While much data has elevation stored, it is not always inside its geometry. Scene Viewer now allows the use of attributes and Arcade expressions as inputs for the elevation of a feature layer. For instance, depth information can be transformed into a negative value, or numbers can be exaggerated to make differences more visible, as we did for the earthquakes below. Whatever the transformation, the powerful language of Arcade lets you position your data accurately. Improved Realistic Effects and Labeling We\u2019ve prioritized enhancing the visual quality in Scene Viewer over the past few years. This release introduces new shading for integrated mesh layers (scene and 3D tiles), improving the lighting and overall appearance of your 3D content. Moreover, we have adjusted the labeling for vector tiles, ma",

    "date": "2024-11-19",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 19, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Experience Builder (November 2024) By Jianxia Song The November 2024 release for ArcGIS Experience Builder in ArcGIS Online introduces many new features to help you easily build no-code and low-code web apps and pages. We\u2019ve added the new Express mode which simplifies app building so you can build apps more efficiently. It includes all the Web AppBuilder classic templates. The new Accordion widget is a layout container that you can use to organize other widgets into a vertically stacked menu with options to expand and collapse. Other highly anticipated enhancements include the new draw text tool in the Draw widget, support for setting custom filters at run time with the Filter widget, searching a specific country or region with the Search widget, and support for Subtype group layers. Let\u2019s dive into these features. Quick links: Express mode Accordion widget Subtype group layer Enhancements Accessibility updates Deprecation Express mode Express mode is designed to make app building easy. It provides familiar template options and workflows for users newly migrating from Web AppBuilder to Experience Builder. Start with a template, choose a map or scene, add widgets, and brand the app. Apps created in this mode are automatically optimized for any screen size. Read this blog post for more information. Note: you can choose a window template from the top-left of the builder toolbar and set it as a splash screen. Unlike the About and Splash widgets in Web AppBuilder, Experience Builder does not yet provide an HTML Editor to easily customize content. This feature is currently planned for the next release. Sometimes you\u2019d like to add your own touch to the app besides what the template offers in Express mode. For example, you may want to make the app header a little bit wider or show a legend on the map directly. To accomplish that, you can move the app or a copy of it to Full mode, where you can use all of the editing capabilities Experience Builder offers. When you do so, all of your app configuration will be carried over to Full mode. Keep in mind, this is one way road. You can\u2019t move an app created in Full mode to Express mode. Accordion widget The Accordion widget is a layout container that you can use to organize other widgets into a vertically stacked menu with expand and collapse buttons. The example on the left stacks multiple Text widgets while the example on the right stacks different widgets. You can also change the header background colors when it expands or collapses. When you click the highlighted area in the header setting, the background and border options will appear. Sometimes you may want to expand the widget from the bottom-up instead of the top-down. You can do so by setting the widget height to Auto and moving the widget to the bottom of the page as shown below. Subtype group layer A new addition to data sources, Subtype group layers are composite feature layers that contain multiple sublayers called subtype layers. They are commonly used to model utility network data. An advantage of subtype group layers is faster performance. In addition to the Map widget, you can now use them in other widgets like the Table widget, as shown in the screenshot below. Note: The Analysis widget does not yet support Subtype group layers. Enhancements When connecting to data, many widgets now have an option to interact with a Map widget in addition to selecting individual layers as shown below. Take the Feature Info widget as an example. When you connect to a Map widget, all applicable layers from the map will be added to the widget so you don\u2019t need to add layers one by one. The new option provides efficiency for working with the map. Draw Many of you have been asking for the ability to add text on a map, like you could do with Web AppBuilder. You can now do so in Experience Builder with the draw text tool in the Draw widget. You can also turn drawn features on or off as a layer that appears in layer lists, such as the Map Layers widget and the Map widget Layers tool. Filter If you want users to create their own filter clauses at run time, you can add custom filters in the Filter widget. Search If you are using the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service, you can now specify a country or region code to narrow search results to that country or region. Near Me Many new features have been added to the Near Me widget, including automatically updating results based on the map extent, showing results on the map for all selected layers regardless of their visibility, and more. Check out this blog post to learn more. Map More improvements are made to interact with the map. When you unselect a feature from a List widget, for instance, you may want to have the map automatically zoom or pan back to its initial extent. You can now do so with a new option added to the Zoom to and Pan to actions when the map responds to Record selection changes from other widgets. In addition, ",

It enhances the situational awareness of your field workforce, streamlines field data collection workflows, and integrates directly in your existing enterprise systems. First released in November of 2020, ArcGIS Field Maps is 4 years old! We\u2019ve experienced remarkable growth in the use of Field Maps and want to express our gratitude to our incredible community for your support and valuable feedback. The November update is our third and last major release of 2024. For details on previous updates this year, please read our what\u2019s new blog articles for June and February. What\u2019s new for November Our November 2024 release includes new ways to get started using Field Maps Designer, additional options for controlling offline use of a map, as well as stability and performance enhancements to both the iOS and Android mobile apps. Please reference our What\u2019s New documentation topic for additional information. Get started using templates Field Maps Designer allows you to configure the maps mobile workers use. Designer can also be used to create new maps and web feature layers. Starting from scratch, you can design a new map, with feature layers, their attributes, forms, and templates for data capture. But why start from scratch? Now you can get started using map templates. When you create a new map, choose to start with a map template. Map templates include predefined layers that are prepared with forms that include logic and calculated expressions, ready-to-use pop-ups, and simple symbology. Once created, you can easily customize the map and layers to fit your needs. This initial release includes the following templates: Ground Control Field Notes Asset Inspections Reading the details of each template, you can quickly understand it\u2019s purpose. Once selected, simply provide a name for the new map and Designer will create it for you and open it so you configure it, create offline areas, and/or share it. This is our introduction to map templates. We plan to add additional templates, and in a future update, we will let you select your own maps as map templates. NOTE: ArcGIS Solutions includes a collection of industry-specific configurations of ArcGIS. You can use the ArcGIS Solutions app to deploy offerings that include Field Maps configurations. New offline settings Field Maps includes additional options for controlling offline use of a specific map through two new settings found in the App Settings tab in Field Maps Designer: New offline map areas \u2013 when disabled, this setting will prevent mobile workers from adding offline areas for the map within the mobile app. To ensure your mobile workforce use the offline map areas created for them, disable the creation of offline map areas. Online maps \u2013 when disabled, this setting will prevent mobile workers from using the online version of a map. It will require mobile workers have an offline map area downloaded to their device before they can open and work with the map. To ensure your mobile workforce is ready for offline map use, disable the use of online maps. These settings are enabled by default and can only be defined when authoring the map; mobile workers cannot override them. To modify these settings in Field Maps Designer, click the App Settings tab, expand the Map group, and use the toggle next to Online maps and New offline map areas to disable settings. In addition to the enhancements mentioned above, we\u2019ve included several performance and stability improvements to Field Maps Designer as well as Field Maps mobile app for iOS and Android.

    "date": "2024-11-07",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Indoor GIS Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Indoors (November 2024) By Gaurav Jobanputra and Sophie Frank ArcGIS Indoors forms the basis of an indoor geographic information system (indoor GIS) that enhances asset and space management, safety and security, and building occupant and visitor experiences. This release introduces 360-degree image support in ArcGIS Enterprise, point cloud-to-floorplan creation, a redesigned Indoors Mobile app, and more. ArcGIS Indoors for ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 and ArcGIS Online (24R03) November Updates ArcGIS Indoors apps have been updated to include an immersive way to visualize spaces and to plan space allocations. Business unit space planning Organizations are made up of different business units. Some examples of business units include School of Engineering or School of Arts at a university for higher education, Administration or Accounting for state and local government offices, Pediatrics or Cardiology at a hospital and Sales, Marketing, or Human Resources at a corporate campus. Space usage varies across different business units within an organization and constantly changes based on growing or shrinking needs. For instance, the Sales department may need fewer individual office spaces due to employees\u2019 frequent travel. Human Resources on the other hand, where more in-person collaboration is necessary, need to be co-located and have designated spaces. At this release, organization areas have been introduced in the ArcGIS Indoors Space Planner. Organization areas can be used to plan and review space allocations to various business units and further facilitate workspace area planning by giving space planners insight into which units are available for assignment. This way, organizations can plan effective distribution of available spaces across the different business units, consolidate space usage for efficient use, ensure the business units are located around the type of spaces like labs or conference rooms that they need to operate effectively, and eventually help with overall cost savings. The organization areas table gives a comprehensive view of space allocations across various business units, while also providing further details related to assigned people and units for individual areas. The map theme is updated to reflect different space allocations. The Create Indoors Database and Update Indoors Database tools have been updated to include the information model updates required to create and manage organization areas. Organization areas can be created for every unique value specified in the ORG_LEVEL_1 field of the Occupants layer which is meant for storing business units of the organization. ArcGIS Indoors for ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 Immersive 360 Degree Photos Support for 360-degree photos was already released in the previous ArcGIS Online release (24R02) and is now also available in ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4. Portable and easy-to-use reality capture devices are being used today to scan building interiors. These devices are equipped with sensors for LiDAR scanning and cameras that capture 360-degree photos. The Import Indoor Images tool allows these photos to be included in the indoor maps and viewed using the Indoors Viewer web app. These photos provide a more comprehensive view of the indoor space and can be very helpful in various situations. For example: A mobile worker who needs to complete an indoor work order can better understand the indoor space and its surroundings to make informed decisions before heading to the location. Remote employees who plan to visit the office can better familiarize themselves with the various locations, including reserved office hotels and meeting rooms they plan to visit, before traveling on-site. ArcGIS Indoors Mobile 2.0 Beta (Update 1) The Indoors mobile apps for iOS and Android are being completely redesigned. In the 2.0 version, the new app sports a new modern look, is more intuitive to use, includes innovative new features, and is built on the new ArcGIS Maps SDK. The Beta version was made available in the Early Adopter Program back in August. 360 photos, progressive navigation using ArcGIS IPS , and support for dark mode were some notable new features along several improvements to common workflows that involve searching, directions and office hotel reservations. The recently released Update 1 includes the capabilities for launch actions and meeting room reservations. Join the Early Adopter Program to learn more about everything new and improved in Indoors Mobile 2.0 Beta and instructions to install the app. Provide your feedback in the forums to help us improve the app to ensure it meets all your needs.

    "date": "2024-11-07",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Indoor GIS Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS IPS (November 2024) By Dejan Parac ArcGIS IPS is an indoor positioning system that enables real-time indoor asset inspections, location sharing, and wayfinding. It visualizes your blue dot location on an indoor map and helps enhance asset management, safety and security, and occupant and visitor experiences. This release introduces enhancements to ArcGIS IPS configurations in ArcGIS Pro, support for offline workflows and 3D visualization, enhancements to the ArcGIS IPS Setup app, and more. Enhancements to ArcGIS IPS Configurations in ArcGIS Pro Indoor Positioning Configuration A new set of configuration options has been added to the Indoor Positioning map properties for IPS-aware maps. You can now manage key features of the IPS engine, including path-snapping, position smoothing, fallback to system GNSS, and Apple IPS support (if available in your indoor environment). The Indoor Positioning Configuration options become available once you make a map IPS-aware by selecting an existing Indoor Positioning Data Service for the Indoor Positioning Data Source property. Path-snapping: If your map contains pathways features configured for IPS usage, you can now simply enable path-snapping via the configurations pane and also specify a snapping distance. During position estimations, the blue dot will be snapped to the closest pathway feature within the set threshold distance. Smoothing: When this option is turned on, it helps smoothen sudden and unexpected position changes to the blue dot. GNSS: Enabling this property allows the blue dot to automatically switch to GNSS when this source of position is more reliable than IPS, e.g. when leaving the building and transitioning to the outdoor environment. Apple IPS: I f this configuration is enabled and an Apple IPS deployment is available for your facility, ArcGIS IPS will consider it as an additional source for positioning and consider it while calculating your indoor position. Support for Fully Disconnected Workflows IPS-aware maps can now be packaged into a Mobile Map Package (MMPK) for offline use. The MMPK includes both the indoor map and indoor positioning data, allowing devices without internet access to continue utilizing indoor positioning capabilities. To create IPS-aware MMPKs, use the \u201cShare Map as a Mobile Map Package\u201d tool and uncheck the option \u201cReference online content\u201d. This update is also part of the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Native Apps release (see bottom of the blog). Indoor Positioning Data Updates You can now update an existing Indoor Positioning Dataset or Data Service without reconfiguring IPS-awareness. Previously, updates required creating new datasets and services, which also meant updating all web maps linked to the previous Indoor Positioning Data Service. At ArcGIS Pro 3.4, the Generate Indoor Positioning Dataset and Share Indoor Positioning Data Service tools have a new option to update existing positioning data. Simply turn the Update Existing Dataset checkbox on and select the existing item that you want to update with new data. 3D Visualization Support Indoor Positioning Datasets are now supported in 3D scenes to provide an enhanced visualization experience for indoor positioning data. Updates to ArcGIS IPS Setup App Beacon deployment and maintenance features Indoor positioning systems typically require some kind of hardware. The majority rely on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon signals as input for indoor position estimations. Sometimes, Wi-Fi signals are used in place of BLE. To capitalize on the benefits of the survey-less indoor positioning data generation method, beacon positions inside the facility must be defined and precisely marked on an indoor map. Aside from the existing option to create and edit features via the ArcGIS Field Maps app\u2019s functionalities, you can now use the ArcGIS IPS Setup app to annotate beacon features through specially tailored workflows. This allows users to quickly deploy and m aintain information about their indoor positioning system infrastructure. This functionality provides the basis for future capabilities such as automatic health (battery) monitoring of IPS networks. Map Settings ArcGIS IPS performance configurations used to be handled at the app level within the user profile. The introduction of map settings now allows path-snapping, and network configuration (more specifically \u2013 survey radio type on Android; and beacon UUID definition on iOS devices) to be defined at the map level allowing more flexibility during IPS enablement and testing. While IPS configurations can be defined in the indoor positioning map property, IPS Setup users will be able overwrite or customize them in map settings for specific conditions testing. New icons for Survey, Recordings, and Layers The ArcGIS IPS Setup app has further been enhanced with updates to the user interface, such as replacing the existing Recordings created list icon and introducing a brand-new Survey ",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript (4.31) By Yixuan 'Emily' Hu The fall release of ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript has arrived, leading by new feature table enhancements and improved drawing experience. Join us as we delve into the highlights of the 4.31 release! Feature Table: save configurations and export features to CSV We continued to bring significant enhancements to feature table, including save out any configuration on how it should display, exporting selected features to CSV, better attachment support, and more. Configure and save display settings: The new attribute table template enables you to configure, save, and reuse your own settings of displaying feature table\u2019s columns. You can define properties such as visibility, order, and sorting of the table\u2019s columns. Tables can contain a variety of elements, such as fields, attachments, and relationships. This new feature simplifies sharing and reusing of table configurations across different applications. For instance, you can reused configured table settings from Map Viewer to custom applications or across multiple custom applications to ensure a consistent user experience. Export selected features to CSV: Selected features can be exported programmatically or with the default \u201cExport selection to CSV\u201d option in feature table\u2019s menu. If point data is being exported, the downloaded CSV file will automatically include columns with latitude and longitude coordinates. Exporting selected features can be combined with interactive highlight, querying, and filtering, achieving seamless workflows beyond the web application. View and update attachments: With the appropriate layer permissions, users can add, update, and delete the feature attachments in feature table. In addition to the mentioned features and improvements, we included pagination for viewing high volumes of records and complete support for viewing and editing feature layers with subtypes and data within subtype group layers. Snap to grid Are you drawing uniformly-shaped parcels and evenly-spaced street lights? We have you covered with the new snap to grid drawing capability. Create a two-dimensional grid and snap feature to the grid with the new grid control widget. The grid is a network of uniformly spaced horizontal and perpendicular lines rendered on the screen to guide drawing. You can interactively move, scale, and rotate the grid, and snap the grid to existing features on the map. Snapping to grid is especially useful for editing and sketching workflow that requires efficient placement of features that conform to a regular grid, such as parcel editing and utility line drawing. Tooltip enhancements Set edge offset in 3D: You can set the distance between edges of 3D objects using the new edge offset field to create exact building setbacks. Draggable tooltip: Drag the tooltip while in input mode to change its position. Binning and clustering now support line and polygon You can aggregate line and polygon geometry to bins or clusters in feature layer. Binning and clustering are client-side operations that help reduce visual clutter and reveal hidden trends behind small features that are hard to see at smaller scales. Learn more about best practices and visualization tips for binning and clustering lines and polygons in the sample. Symbol animations (beta) Draw attention to features with the new symbol animations using CIM symbol. Symbol animations allow you to accentuate features by animating a point or marker\u2019s color, offset, rotation, size, or transparency. Animations can be used to highlight the freshness of data, draw attention to specific features, or just create an engaging visualization in your 2D map. Icon rotation in 3D Enhance 3D thematic visualizations with the ability to rotate 2D billboarded icons within a 3D scene view. This is particularly helpful to show directional data such as wind direction at weather stations. What\u2019s new with components We expanded the SDK\u2019s component offerings with new components, enhancements, and improved documentation. Standards-based web components introduce a new way to build web apps for maximizing productivity and is the recommended pattern for all new apps. Embeddable components: We introduced the embedded map component for quickly embedding a saved web map into a website seamlessly with default components (i.e. zoom, legend, bookmarks) pre-configured. By setting the properties and/or attributes in HTML, developers can easily change the web map, UI components, and theme with no JavaScript required. The example below shows how to include a trail web map with embedded map component. Embedded map component empowers developers to include interactive web map easily in non-map-centered websites for more geographical context.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Decision Support Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Mission 11.4 By Parrish Henderson ArcGIS Mission is Esri\u2019s solution to organizational command and control when it is paramount to keep everyone connected. ArcGIS Mission provides a constant flow of information between a command element and coordinating responders to include: location relay, reporting of events, communications between Mission members, and dispatching capabilities. At 11.4 we are introducing some features and enhancements that many of you have requested and we are excited to share them as capabilities of the system. Increased Mission Flexibility through Tasking Enhancements This release we took a close look at our current tasking capabilities, looking for ways to improve the current experience overall. The focus was to make the entire tasking experience more flexible to meet users needs. Now those who are able to assign tasks can: Create a task as unassigned Assign a task without requiring a location Assign a task to multiple members of a mission Assign a task to themselves Assign themselves to a task (manager only) that is marked as unassigned Task Types Keep Tasks Organized Mission Owners and Administrators can configure task types, which can be used to categorize tasks. This feature helps organizations keep track of tasks based of a category rather than by their individual task titles. Task types are configured through an interface in the newly introduced \u201cTasks\u201d tab and can have as many types as desired. Owners and Administrators can enable an option to allow users in a Mission Lead role to create task types, if desired. Allowing this gives leads the ability to add new types during the mission as operations are ongoing from the tasking interface. All your Missions Tasks in One Searchable Status View Available in the new tasks tab as well as from the task pane inside of Mission Analyst, the task table provides mission managers with a real-time view of tasking metrics. These metrics include the total number of tasks in the system, a breakdown of the number of tasks by status, tasks by type, and a full list of all individual tasks. This list of tasks can be quickly sorted, searched, and filtered to provide quick answers to any questions. Additionally, selecting a task status or type from the selection boxes on the left hand side will filter tasks based on the selection. Providing Indoor Situational Awareness with Flooraware If your organization has Flooraware maps configured correctly on the portal, these maps can be used in any mission. The properties will be honored in both Mission Manager and Mission Responder. In order for Flooraware to work properly a mission must be created using that Flooraware web map as the basemap. Geofencing keeps your Responders more Aware Geofences can be configured natively from within ArcGIS Mission Manager edit map interface. Geofences are based off polygon layers that are available in a mission map and allow users to configure one or many polygons of a layer as the geofence trigger. Geofence layers can have a buffer around them that is set by the user, an entry and exit message scripted by the author, and the ability to be rendered as active or inactive. Mission Responders that are connected to the active mission with geofences enabled will receive either an entry or exit notification based on their movement through the alerting polygon. These alerts will appear as notifications at the top of the responder application. Some Chats are More Important than Others Any mission member that is sending or responding to a chat from either Mission Manager or Mission Responder will have the option to mark the chat as important. This will allow important information to stand out among others in the chat thread. Each chat that is marked as important will show the word Important preceded by a flag icon that is colored red. To mark a chat with importance, a user in mission manager would use chat as they normally would, but a toggle is located at the bottom of the window. A responder will need to select the \u201c+\u201d to the left of their chat operation, and select important. Living Atlas Integration for Up-to-Date Information When an organizational portal is configured in the settings to enable Living Atlas layers, Mission Owners and Admins can add Living Atlas layers natively, while in edit map and add them to the mission map. If there are multiple layers associated with the chosen Living Atlas layer, all or any of the sublayers may be set as active on the map. Keyboard Shortcuts provide faster Mission Navigation At 11.4, we enabled \u201chotkeys\u201d or more formally keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts allow near mouse-less connectivity to navigate through the details page quickly as well as provide faster access to Broadcasts, Chats, Tasks, and Reports in the Mission Analyst view. To understand what shortcuts are available, a mission user would start by selecting the \u201cAlt\u2019 key and the \u201c?\u201d to obtain a list of the availabl",
    "summary": "ArcGIS Mission 11.4 introduces several enhancements to improve organizational command and control. Key updates include:\n- More flexible tasking, allowing unassigned tasks, tasks without locations, and assigning tasks to multiple members \n- Configurable task types to better categorize and organize tasks\n- A searchable task status view providing real-time metrics on all tasks\n- Indoor situational awareness with Flooraware maps \n- Geofencing to alert responders when entering or exiting defined areas\n- Ability to flag important chats for visibility\n- Integration with Living Atlas layers \n- Keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation\n- Battery optimization mode for responder devices",

    "date": "2024-11-18",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 18, 2024 What's new in Printing from Map Viewer By Zara Matheson The November 2024 ArcGIS Online update includes some exciting enhancements to the Print experience in Map Viewer. Last release we introduced the beta option to print from layout template items published directly to ArcGIS Online. At that time, you had to create a specific print template group for your org to access the items. For the November release, we have added the capability to browse for these items directly from the print tool to the beta offering. For all users we now also provide the option to save your print export as an ArcGIS Online item, allowing for quick access and easy sharing. The last print enhancement for this release allows you to define a different Spatial reference for your print export. Save exported Print items to My Content Your exported print files can now be saved as ArcGIS Online items! To access this new functionality, ensure that you are signed in to ArcGIS Online and create a print export. From the Exports tab, click the Options menu and select Save as. Fill out the required information and the export will be saved to your content. You can then easily share your exported files with others. Note \u2013 Saving AIX, EPS, SVG, and SVGZ items to My Content is not supported. Browse for Print Templates Last summer we introduced the option (beta) to print from layout items published directly to ArcGIS Online. This enhancement allowed users to create and publish their own layout items from ArcGIS Pro to ArcGIS Online and use them without having to set up and maintain their own print server. This is especially useful if you want to add your organization\u2019s logo or branding to your print output or require more room to support a larger legend. One limitation of the Print template group is that printing from these layout items is only available when a template group is configured and that requires an admin to set it up. Now users can access any template they want without having a group configured. To access this capability, ensure that you have a Professional or Professional plus user type and open the print tool. Click into the templates and then click the Browse templates button. The added templates will be displayed under My templates and can be removed at any time. Printing from these items will always use the ArcGIS print service, even if you have a custom print service configured Note \u2013 If you are not signed in, don\u2019t have privileges (Professional or Professional Plus user type) , or your organization has beta access disabled, you will not see this option. Set an Output Spatial Reference By default, your print exports are generated using the spatial reference of your map. Print now provides the option to set an output spatial reference using a WKID of your choice. In this example, I have a web map focused on Canada in Web Mercator, but I want the print export to have a more suitable projection. I can input the WKID of 102002 to use the Canada Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate system instead. What\u2019s Next? While still in beta, printing from custom layouts is free to use for all Professional and Professional Plus users. Once out of beta, there will be a credit charge associated with printing from these custom layout items. We also continue to improve the overall print experience in Map Viewer and ArcGIS Online.

Web style groups are now supported, allowing you to configure custom symbology for your entire organization to use in Sketch. With this release, Sketch also supports snapping to a grid when drawing features on the map & accessing a filtered list of fonts saved in the web map. We\u2019ve also tweaked the overall layout to improve usability. Read more about these enhancements below! A Sketch Specific Web Style Group Sketch users have been able to add web styles directly to sketch from ArcGIS Online for a while, but we received feedback that users would like to be able to set an organization level web style group up for sketch, just as they can when adjusting layer symbology from the Styles pane. Sketch now supports a sketch specific web style group that can be configured under the Map section in your Organization settings. For information on publishing and preparing a web style group, please refer to this blog article. The only difference is that you will reference the group with your desired Sketch symbols in the 2D sketch web style group instead of the 2D web style group (You can also reference the same group in both categories). Once your group is set up, the symbols will be availble in the Sketch symbol gallery for all users in your organization. This allows easy access to symbols your organization regularly uses. Snapping to a Grid while Drawing With this latest update you can now snap to a grid when drawing features. Enable this setting in the Sketch settings, then adjust the grid as required. You can move, rotate, and scale the grid as needed. Please see this blog post for detailed information on this new capability. In this example, I am using the grid to draw a number of farmer\u2019s market stalls with consistent spacing and sizing. I can then take advantage of the duplicate option in Sketch to duplicate a group of them and move them to another part of my map. Improved User Experience and a Filtered Font List For this release, the overall design of the sketch pane has been improved for easier navigation. Recent symbols have been moved into a new Style section and feature title has been renamed feature name to reduce confusion with the pop-up title. See if you can spot all the changes in the new version (left) below. Another small, but very useful enhancement, added at this release is a filtered font list based on the fonts already used in your web map. Take advantage of this feature to create Sketch text features using the same fonts as your map\u2019 vector tile or feature layers (as long as they are using standard ArcGIS Online fonts). We continue to improve the Sketch experience in Map Viewer with each release, so keep an eye out for new enhancements as they are announced!

Continue reading as we explore these topics in the detail\u2026 Custom sort for Bar charts You can now customize how bar chart categories are sorted to match your preferences. For example, if you want to arrange the days of the week in their natural order, just choose custom sort from the dropdown to rearrange them easily. Temporal guides Temporal bar charts and line charts now support temporal guides so you can annotate a specific date or range of dates in your chart. For instance, if you want to call out a date with a particularly low value you can do that by adding a guide at that specific date. Bar chart categories from numeric fields Typically, we use a category field to create bars in a bar chart, right? But if you want each bar in your chart to match a column in your table, you can make a bar chart using numeric fields as categories. For example, with this county election data, I can make a bar chart with three bars by picking three numeric fields \u2013 total votes democrat, total votes republican, and total votes other, and setting the aggregation to sum. Now each bar in the chart is the sum of values for its corresponding numeric field. And you\u2019ll notice if I use pie chart symbology with those same fields the bars in the chart will match the pie slice colors in the map. Support for subtype group layers Last but not least, we\u2019ve expanded our support to include another type of data source \u2018subtype sublayers\u2019 from subtype group layers.

Administrators and members are encouraged to configure Map Viewer as their primary map viewer to take advantage of new capabilities and enhancements that are delivered with each update. Here\u2019s an overview of new features and enhancements to Map Viewer delivered in this update. Multi tab view To enable users to move quickly between workflows, Map Viewer now supports multiple tabs at the bottom of the map. Tabs are used to move quickly and easily between open tables, charts, models, and raster function templates, delivering the ability to move quickly between them and providing an improved workflow experience. Tabs can be displayed at different heights, and can be minimized to have a full view of the map without needing to close them. Embed maps Map sharing is simplified using the new Embed map tool, found on the Contents (dark) toolbar. You can quickly customize the look and feel of the map by choosing light or dark modes, toggling map elements, and configuring actions. Copy the HTML that is generated to use in a web page, such as a blog or your organization\u2019s website Improved table functionality In the Calculate Field window, you can now choose between Arcade and SQL to build field calculation expressions. Filters can be used to perform calculations on a subset of features. Fields and functions can be quickly inserted into expressions using the Arcade editor or the new SQL expression editor. Your calculation values can also be previewed before running the calculation, ensuring the desired results. Scripts can also be downloaded and saved for future use. For more information, see The new SQL field calculate experience. Attachments can now be deleted, downloaded, updated, or viewed from within the table. You can also now add attachments using a familiar file browsing experience, or drag and drop supported files into the Attachment column. Changes made to the field visibility, field order, and data sorting from within the attribute table in Map Viewer can now be saved to the web map or layer item. These configurations are visible when the attribute table is reopened. Improved charts Like maps, charts help uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in data. When used in conjunction with maps, charts can help you tell a more complete story with your data. The following improvements are introduced in this update: Bar charts and box plots now support a custom sort option so you can customize them to your preference. For example, you can arrange days in the week in a chart to their natural order. Bar charts and line charts using date fields now support temporal axis guides for dates or date ranges, enabling you to bring attention to a specific date or range of dates in your chart. Bar charts can now be created using only numeric fields. The field name will be used as the categorical variable on the x-axis. Charts are now supported for subtype sublayers from subtype group layers. For more information on supported layers for charts, see Configure charts.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog 3D Visualization & Analytics Nov 12, 2024 What's New in Scene Viewer (Nov 2024) By Jasmine Du We\u2019re thrilled to announce the latest features and enhancements included in our November release! These updates bring significant improvements, including critical tools for analysis, the ability to create immersive experiences with oriented imagery, and enhanced usability. The integration of new analysis tools into Scene Viewer is elevating its capabilities to new heights. These enhanced features enable you to explore the relationships between 3D objects and reveal spatial data patterns within a 3D context. Interactive Viewshed Analysis One of the key new additions is the ability to perform viewshed analysis within 3D scenes interactively. You can identify visible and obstructed areas from specific viewpoints, making this feature particularly useful for industries such as security, urban planning, and real estate, where visibility plays a critical role. You can adjust distance, tilt, heading, horizontal and vertical field of view. Multiple viewsheds can be generated to enhance coverage analysis, and results can be easily shared via web scene slides, improving collaboration and decision-making. Together with the other interactive analysis tools like measurement, elevation profile, line of sight, and slice, you will be able to explore 3D context and generate impactful geospatial analysis and communication. Note: When placing viewsheds interactively, the viewshed is created with a 1.5-meter vertical offset from the scene. Web-based Spatial Analysis Spatial analysis involves examining the locations, attributes, and relationships of spatial features to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Scene Viewer now supports spatial analysis directly within the 3D web environment. This feature allows you to perform a variety of spatial analysis tasks seamlessly without having to switch between 2D and 3D interfaces. In this release, we introduce 26 Feature Analysis tools and 13 Raster Analysis tools with the plan to support more in the future. Feature analysis is performed on vector data sources, which is coordinate-based data that represents geographic features using points, lines, and polygons. Imagery and raster data contains information that can be used to identify patterns, find features, and understand change across landscapes using Raster analysis tools. All of these asynchronous tools are performed on the server and will return accurate results as layers, which can be used in web scenes afterwards. We will have another blog to illustrate the details of how to best use the features. Note: The administrator of your organization will need to grant you the required privileges to perform analysis. Learn more about licensing requirements from here. Initial support of Oriented Imagery layer An oriented imagery layer is a type of feature layer for visualizing oriented imagery in the context of 2D or 3D. You can bring a published Oriented Imagery layer to Scene Viewer to provide inspections and real-time situational awareness in 3D context. This release marks an initial step toward incorporating diverse image types, including drone imagery, street-level photos, and mobile captures, into your web scene. You will be able to configure your customized application with authorized web scenes that include the Oriented Imagery layer. Below is an example of using ArcGIS Instant App 3D Viewer template to create and share a focused 3D oriented imagery web app, so you can quickly visualize imagery from an intuitive perspective in the context of 3D data (like integrated mesh or point clouds). This enhancement improves data visualization, streamlining decision-making processes and enhancing overall workflows. Additionally, we plan to introduce an explorer tool in the future to facilitate navigation through the imagery. Support for Catalog Layer Properties and Styles Over this June release, Scene Viewer introduced Catalog layer. In this release, we are adding layer properties for Catalog layers, including visibility controls, making it easier to work with spatial data directly in ArcGIS Online. This update will be particularly useful when working with large spatial datasets, allowing for quicker and more efficient data integration. Set up default 3D Basemap at the Organizational Level Organization administors can now set a default 3D basemap for Scene Viewer users, ensuring consistency across projects and users. Whether you\u2019re handling large datasets or require a standardized 3D environment, this enhancement promotes a more efficient and cohesive workflow across your organization. 3D model upload enhancements Another enhancement in this release focuses on improving the usability of the 3D model uploading feature.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 12, 2024 What's New in Instant Apps (November 2024) By Matt Payne The November 2024 ArcGIS Online update introduces new features and key updates throughout the site. The same applies for ArcGIS Instant Apps, as we have rolled out many updates and new features to our existing apps, further improved choosing and managing your apps on the Instant Apps home page, introduced three new app templates, and addressed various bugs and enhancements to help stabilize and improve your experience across the site. See the highlights below. New app: Compare Visualize data at one or more locations using multiple maps and scenes with side-by-side or stacked layouts in the new Compare app template. Choose between two comparison modes to compare multiple maps at the same location or compare multiple locations of the same map. This app supports up to 4 maps, scenes, or a combination of both. Import bookmarks or slides, or create locations manually to compare areas of the same map or scene. The views can be synced or unsynced when using the app. Use Multiple maps mode to compare different data at the same location such as housing cost, homeownership, and median income. Use the app configuration to choose each map containing the different data variables. Use Single map mode to compare data at multiple locations, such as the impact of sea level rise for different global cities. Choose a map containing sea level rise data in the app configuration then create locations manually to add to the layout or import bookmarks to automatically create locations to compare. Map synchronization has been updated and simplified. Enable the \u201cSynchronize maps\u201d setting in the configuration to add a sync button to the app. The app viewer can use this button to enable universally synchronized map navigation across all maps or locations in the app. Enable the \u201cSynchronize maps on load\u201d setting in the configuration if you want the app to load with all maps or locations automatically synced. For simplicity reasons, this setting uses the extent of the map chosen as \u201cMap 1\u201d in the configuration. A new setting has been added to both comparison modes to let the app creator decide how many maps or locations are visible in the app layout. Use this setting to have control over the look and feel of the layout regardless of the number of maps included for comparison. For example, choose to have \u201c2\u201d visible maps in the layouts to preserve the side-by-side look but offer up to four different maps in the app to compare. The app viewer can access the additional maps using the drop-down menus on the title headers. Also new is a right-side toolbar that contains universal tools. These are any tools that are universal to the whole app such as Synchronize maps, Language switcher, Share, etc. Note that this toolbar is conditional to the presence of the app header. When the app header is enabled, these tools will display in the header and the right-side toolbar is removed. Take a look at our ArcGIS Instant Apps: Introducing Compare blog for a full introduction and information about how to take advantage of Compare\u2019s most useful abilities and settings. New app: Observer Summarize attribute information from data in a scene using a dynamic scoreboard with Observer. This new scene-based app allows you to include a basic set of scene exploration tools to help inspect locations and identify statistics that could be of interest to users. Set up the Statistics summary in the app configuration on the Observer tab to display statistics about features in the scene. Use operators such as average, count, sum, maximum value, and minimum value on feature attributes that will update dynamically as the extent of the scene in the app changes. For example, set up summary statistics to show key metrics about local trails such as the maximum gain and high point. Pan and zoom the scene to see these statistical values update for the visible extent of the data. New with this release is the ability to set up attribute filters and support for time-enabled data. On the Interactivity > Attribute filter tab of the app configuration, set up filters that can be used in the app to further narrow down features that are displayed in the scene. Set up both predefined and user input filters while creating or configuring a new filter. Use the settings on the Interactivity > Time tab of the configuration to set up how the app will display and support any time-enabled layers you have. This setting adds a time slider to the app with basic controls. New app: Streamflow Viewer Interact with streamflow forecast data through a chart and time slider using the new Streamflow Viewer template. This app includes two different 10-day river forecast services, the GEOGLOWS Streamflow forecast service for global coverage from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), and the United States National Water Model service for US coverage from the National Weather Service.

    "date": "2024-11-12",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 12, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Data Pipelines (November 2024) By Bethany Scott and Halle Martinucci In February, we released ArcGIS Data Pipelines, a powerful tool that streamlines data integration in ArcGIS Online. This innovative app offers a fast and efficient way to bring in datasets, geospatially enable them, clean and prepare them, and write the processed data out to a feature layer ready for use in mapping, analysis, and reporting. Available to all Creators and above in ArcGIS Online, Data Pipelines provides you with a low-code, drag-and-drop approach to data engineering, making it easier than ever to design and automate your data integration workflows. In the June update of Data Pipelines, we added support for new input file formats, enhanced the Calculate field tool to support Arcade geometry functions, and made a few enhancements to scheduling including the ability to schedule more frequent updates. What\u2019s New in November? The November 2024 update of Data Pipelines includes new tools, the ability to document your workflow using notes, a new output method to overwrite existing layers, and more. Check out the video below to see some new features in action or keep reading for more information. New data engineering tools Use two new tools, Pivot and Dissolve, to distill your data into summarized and transformed datasets. With the Pivot tool, you can categorize and transform your long, tabular datasets with many records into wide datasets with many fields. This tool can help you explore trends, limit your data to values and attributes of interest, or group your data into summarized categories. Additionally, summarized pivot results can be visualized in dashboards or used for charting. For example, you can create a pivot table using election data to capture voter turnout by geographic region and age group, or any other demographic. Dissolve can complete similar aggregations, but instead of acting on attributes alone, it also considers polygon or polyline geometries to identify relationships between records. For example, you can use Dissolve if you want to merge California county polygons into a single state polygon. If each county has population counts or other demographic information, you can choose to calculate summary statistics for them. Document your workflow using notes You asked, and we listened! We\u2019re excited to introduce the ability to add notes to your data pipeline, allowing you to document your process. Use notes to add context to individual workflow elements or provide an overview of the entire data pipeline. You can use notes however you want, but here are some examples of how notes could be used based on feedback from other Data Pipelines users: You work on the same data pipeline as a colleague, and you want to track the change you made so they are aware of it. You want to share the data pipeline with your peers so they can complete the same workflow. You can use notes to outline what each step does and why it\u2019s used. You maintain multiple data pipelines that are used for various purposes. You can add a general note to add details about the overall workflow, how the results are used, where the source data comes from, etc. You invested a lot of time in creating an Arcade expression used to calculate a new field, and you want to take note of your findings throughout the process. Click here to learn more about adding notes to a data pipeline. Overwrite existing feature layers Exploring data and building data prep workflows is rarely a linear process. Sometimes the source data updates and you now have more fields to wrangle, or you realize you need to configure another tool to make a dataset spatial. And sometimes these changes happen after you\u2019ve already created an output layer. So how do you update a layer to pick up new fields or geometry types? Using the new overwrite output option! Unlike the replace or add and update output methods, overwrite lets you add or remove fields from the layer. You can also use overwrite to change the geometry type of a feature layer. This means that if you accidentally output a table before creating a geometry, use overwrite to update the layer. There are some limitations to overwrite that you should be aware of. For example, you cannot use overwrite to change the spatial reference of an existing layer, and you can\u2019t overwrite a layer that was not created by Data Pipelines. There are other considerations to make when using overwrite that you can learn about in the output feature layer documentation. Other new features In addition to the features above, we\u2019ve also added the following: Credit estimation\u2014While using the editor, you can now view a credit estimation in the connection details dialog. Click on the connected status to expand the dialog and there you\u2019ll find the estimated number of credits that have been consumed while you\u2019ve been engineering your data prep workflow.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 18, 2024 What's new in ArcGIS Maritime (November 2024) By Krista Carlson The lastest release of ArcGIS Maritime includes new tools and enhancements that allow you to create better charts and do more with your maritime data. Manage S-57 Products in ArcGIS Pro Perhaps most notable is the brand-new S-57 Product Manager tool, which allows you to more efficiently manage, publish, and export S-57 products in ArcGIS Pro. While exporting products was already possible, you can now export from the S-57 Product Manager pane, where you can view and organize the products in a database. This new tool is included on the Maritime S-57 tab of the ArcGIS Pro ribbon, in the S-57 Editing group. Learn more about the S-57 Product Manager Edit existing light sectors In ArcGIS Pro 3.3, you could generate light sectors for your chart products. With ArcGIS Pro 3.4, you can also edit existing light sectors with the Edit Light Sector tool. This tool allows you to shorten or lengthen light sector limit lines and adjust the placement of the color arc so to draw attention to light sectors and reduce conflicts with other chart elements. Learn more about how you can edit light sectors Scale band refinements The S-57 Set Scale Band tool group on the Maritime S-57 tab has also been expanded\u2014a new Append Filter tool makes it possible to revise an existing scale band filter, add a filter to an existing query, and add layers to a filter. You now can also enable or disable conflation. Learn more about filtering maritime data by scale band ArcGIS Maritime server On the server side, ArcGIS Maritime server offers new capabilities with the release of ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4. This includes enhanced custom symbology for wrecks, fairways, navigation lines, and recommended tracks. Additional Lua properties for feature objects are also available with this release, including properties for feature and dataset compilation scales. Labeling for features is also improved\u2014using the rotateWithFeature Lua property now provides a way to rotate text to align with features. These are just a few of the new things you can do.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 08, 2024 What's new in ArcGIS Production Mapping By Josue Aguirre At the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 and ArcGIS Pro 3.4 releases, the ArcGIS Production Mapping extension contains multiple updates. From tool enhancements in ArcGIS Pro, to functionalities in ArcGIS Enterprise, read on to find out how your organization can benefit from these updates across the Pro and Enterprise platform. Compass rose north arrow One of the enhancements at this release is a new compass rose topographic north arrow that includes a 360-degree dial. It is implemented like the other surround element and can be found in the Additional Surrounds gallery under the Topographic elements. The 360-degree dial is oriented toward magnetic north. ArcGIS Pro tools The Topographic Production toolbox has a new tool along with other enhancement to existing tools at this release. Calculate Metrics When using the Calculate Metrics tool, you can limit the data overwritten to null values using a new Only populate NULL values parameter. When the check box for this parameter is checked, the tool spares existing values and only calculates values for fields that are empty or have a \u201cnull\u201d value. Generate Adjoining Sheets Features The Generate Adjoining Sheets Features tool was enhanced to allow for fine tuning of how many sheets are included in an adjoining sheets diagram when working with a custom area of interest (AOI). Typically, you would see nine sheets in the diagram. This consists of the area of interest sheet and the eight bordering sheets. The eight sheets are selected and included in the diagram when the Scale parameter value is defined. This value corresponds to other values associated with the map specification being generated, which are fed into a buffer process. At ArcGIS Pro 3.4, the buffer size is exposed as a new parameter that appears when the Scale parameter\u2019s new \u201cNone\u201d option is chosen. On a custom AOI, you can define the size of this buffer. The surrounding sheets that fall within the buffer will be included in the adjoining sheets diagram. Generate Isogonic Lines The toolbox has a new Generate Isogonic Lines tool that, well, generates isogonic lines. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has Lines of Equal Magnetic Variation databases that it updates every five years. This new tool is for organizations that are unable to populate an existing feature class using these databases and need to generate their own data that is used to generate the isogonic lines. Isogonic lines are smooth curved lines that connect a series of points that have an equal magnetic variation value. Different map product specifications require different line feature styles. The new tool computes the points, and uses the Calculate Magnetic Components tool to calculate the declination value (the angle between geographic and magnetic north) for these points based on the World Magnetic Model. The tool then creates line features that connect the points with equal magnetic variation and populates an existing feature class with the line features. Deprecation The tools in the Workflow toolset have been deprecated. These tools were intended to be used as steps in workflows using Workflow Manager (Classic), which is deprecated at ArcGIS Pro 3.4. Enterprise Map Production System web app The enhancements included with the extension don\u2019t stop there. At the Enterprise 11.4 release, new functionalities have been introduced to the Map Production System (MPS) web app. Export settings The app also has new functionalities for administrators. They can specify how often job statuses are refreshed in the Map Exports Status pane of the app for your organization\u2019s members that are using the app. On the same token, app administrators can specify how many service requests can be submitted over a specified period. Learn more about these settings Batch options The Map Exports Status pane in the app has been updated with more options in a toolbar so that you can perform batch operations to the selected jobs. You can now select multiple jobs by pressing the Ctrl key while you click jobs. Alternatively, you can click a job and then another while pressing the Shift key to select a range of jobs. Once selected, the toolbar offers the options to cancel, delete, or download jobs. The toolbar also now displays the total number of jobs, as well as the number of jobs selected. This comes in handy when the list of jobs is longer than what can be displayed in the pane. Branding To support your organization\u2019s branding, the appearance of the app can be further modified now with a new splash screen option. Simply specify an image when configuring the app and voila, the image will appear when the app is loaded. But wait developers, there\u2019s more Last and certainly not least, the extension\u2019s REST API has been enhanced.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 08, 2024 What's new in ArcGIS Defense Mapping By Josue Aguirre At the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 and ArcGIS Pro 3.4 releases, the ArcGIS Defense Mapping extension contains significant updates including enhancements to the product data files that ship with the extension for use across both the Pro and Enterprise platform. Compass rose north arrow One of the enhancements at this release is a new compass rose topographic north arrow that includes a 360-degree dial. It is implemented like the other surround element and can be found in the Additional Surrounds gallery under the Topographic elements. This north arrow is primarily designed for the Evasive Chart (EVC) map product, which is now a supported map product with the Defense Mapping extension. The 360-degree dial is oriented toward Magnetic north. Product data files At the 11.4 and 3.4 releases, the product data files included with the ArcGIS Defense Mapping extension contain new and updated items. MTM25 The extension added support for the Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP) Topographic Map (MTM) at a 1:25,000 map scale. This included files for its layout, and bridge and building offset rules: pagx xml xml This addition spans across both ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Enterprise with entries in the DMDProducts.json and DMSProducts.json, respectively. Evasive Chart Support for the new EVC map product meant a lot of new files. Style file Prior to this release, some different map products shared style files. Now, the product files include individual style files for each supported map products. The new EVC map product is no exception as an EVC.stylx file has also been added to ensure that support for it is complete. Layout files Layout files for the EVC map product are available with the product files at this release. Because EVCs are double-sided, two .pagx files have been added: an EVC_Front.pagx file for the front and an EVC_Back.pagx file for the back. Other EVC support files A new EVC cartographic database (EVC.gdb, EVC.gdb.zip) has been added for the EVC map product. Part of the cartographic refinement process employs three refinement rule files. They have been built out for the EVC map product. This includes the following: xml xml xml While some files meant for other map products could be used to produce the EVC map product, official ones specifically for an EVC have been added: EVC_BaseMap_Single_NE.xml EVC_BaseMap_Single_NE_80-90NS.xml EVC_BaseMap_Single_NW.xml EVC_BaseMap_Single_NW_80-90NS.xml EVC_BaseMap_Single_SE.xml EVC_BaseMap_Single_SW.xml EVC_BaseMap_Zipper_NE.xml EVC_BaseMap_Zipper_NW.xml EVC_BaseMap_Zipper_SE.xml EVC_BaseMap_Zipper_SW.xml EVC_RegionalReferenceDiagram.xml Existing map products While developing files for EVCs, all the files, regardless of intended map product have been heavily updated for a hard refresh. There were extensive updates to label expressions and logic, new symbols were added, and symbology changes made to the following to meet industry specification standards: JOG 1.2 Topographic Map (TM) MTM 1.3 Minor items Some minor items include tweaks to rules that govern at which map scale symbology will display polygon features as point features, and fixes for minor bugs in existing map products such as a subtype naming typo. A layer name for the Joint Operations Graphic (JOG) map product was updated to reflect a color change made to the standard specification. Lastly, continued removal of Spot Color descriptions that followed number codes in Spot color names has been completed to include layout surround elements. Area of Interest indexes The MapIndex geodatabase file has been updated to meet new specifications. This file contains the Area of Interest indexes for multiple map products. ArcGIS Pro tools The Topographic Production toolbox has a new tool along with other enhancement to existing tools at this release.

    "date": "2024-11-04",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 04, 2024 What's new in ArcGIS Data Interoperability at Pro 3.4 By Bruce Harold and Nolan Reichmann With the release of ArcGIS Pro at version 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise at version 11.4, we are pleased to announce several new features that will improve the functionality and usability of ArcGIS Data Interoperability. In this article, we will look at the following enhancements: Web Tool Scheduling ArcGIS OnlineConnector & Metadata Supported DuckDB database Forward (Batch) geocoding Improvement on User Experience/User Interaction Web Tool Scheduling The introduction of web tool scheduling marks a significant milestone for ArcGIS Data Interoperability. This feature, which has been highly requested, enhances the functionality and efficiency of data management. The constant need to synchronize data between systems of record is a common usage pattern for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). This process can now be moved from Pro machines to Enterprise servers by scheduling the synchronization using this new tool. Not only does this new tool save time by allowing the user to schedule synchronization tasks, but it also ensures that these tasks are executed both consistently and reliably, relieving the user of the burden of manually synchronizing their data. For additional information including a demonstration on how to use the tool, please refer to our ETL Pattern: Scheduling Web Tools blog post on the Esri Community website. ArcGIS OnlineConnector & Metadata The ArcGISOnlineConnector transformer now supports getting and setting metadata from portal items. When working with portal items, you can now bring metadata along with the actual data using your ETL workflows. This feature is available for use with ArcGIS Pro at version 3.4, but for users still working with version 3.3, the process for using this valuable capability is outlined in our ArcGIS Blog post, Metadata \u2013 Data Interoperability\u2019s Hidden Talent (Part Two) This new feature improves the quality of your data by allowing the inclusion and setting of metadata, which improves the depth and breadth of data analysis. Also, ArcGIS feature services now support timestamp offset and big integer field types, bringing them into line with the geodatabase formats, ensuring that your data can flow between the two environments without issue. Supported DuckDB database The popular DuckDB database is now supported as a SQL-compliant database that includes reader/writer capabilities as well as the ability to create SQL queries (SQLCreator) and to execute SQL queries (SQLExecutor). Now that this database is supported at version 1.0.0, it allows the user to dynamically load extensions, like the spatial extension, into their user profile. Since DuckDB is a database and supports virtual filesystems (URL paths to cloud object stores), users can virtualize data access in real-time, making remote files work like database objects. As demonstrated in the Esri Community blog post, ETL Pattern: Working With Cloud Well-Known Files, users can script DuckDB to read a virtualized view of data in an object store. That workflow can now be automated using ArcGIS Data Interoperability and a SQL Executor. Adding this capability to ArcGIS Data Interoperability increases the ease and accessibility of this product, making it a versatile and valuable asset for anyone\u2019s toolbox. Forward (Batch) Geocoding The Geocoder transformer, which allows the conversion of addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates, now offers a Forward (Batch) geocoding method when using ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Server geocoding services. This feature is scalable, allowing the user to improve throughput compared to processing single addresses per call. This ability to customize the batch size helps improve efficiency and eliminates time-consuming processes. Moreover, when used in combination with a custom locator view service URL you can reliably and efficiently create geometry from location information, like place names or addresses. Improvement on User Experience/User Interaction In an effort to improve the user experience and interaction with ArcGIS Data Interoperability, several updates have been made to the interface and apps. In the Workbench app, typing into the canvas has an autocomplete experience that shows format reader/writers, transformers and even Hub transformers. We have also updated the system to allow the user to filter based on the category buttons. By simply double clicking on an entry, it can be added to the canvas. Enhancements have also been made to the HTTPCaller. It now includes a test preview in the dialog box while authoring the configuration. The Import OpenAPI feature in previous releases of the HTTPCaller is now officially a standalone transformer called OpenAPICaller. You can select your Endpoints directly from your API Specification in YAML or JSON files. A query test control is offered in both the HTTPCaller and OpenAPICaller, so users can view returned JSON files in a tree ",

The easy-to-use builder enables you to combine maps, 3D scenes, embedded content, multimedia, and more to create an interactive narrative that can inspire interest \u2014 and action \u2014 from your readers. Each month, our team uses community feedback to help inform new capabilities that can enhance your storytelling adventures. Check out what\u2019s new this month! Quick links Preserve extent or scale in map appearance Clip express map to image aspect ratio Search current map area (in builder) Add captions to gallery images Post-publish sharing screen And more\u2026 Preserve extent or scale in map appearance It\u2019s only natural that we heavily rely on maps when we use place-based storytelling to communicate our work, so having control over the perspective of our maps to complement the narrative is essential. Mappers, rejoice! We are excited to introduce the choice between preserving the extent or the scale of the web and express maps in your stories and briefings. Previously, some maps may have looked differently than you wanted across different screen, window, and container sizes, especially if you used scale-dependent layers. There were also some less-than-ideal viewing experiences, such as your map symbols piling on each other in a smaller map viewer (i.e., tablet or mobile view). Now, you can choose to present your dynamic maps in the manner that best suits your story, whether preserving their extent or scale. Choosing to preserve your map\u2019s scale versus extent enables you to control the level of detail your reader sees better. If it\u2019s more important that your reader can effectively engage with your map\u2019s symbology, for instance, opting to preserve scale may provide a better viewing experience. Additionally, choosing between extent or scale complements fractional zoom, which allows for more refined map placement. You can find this new option in the Adjust map appearance options under the Map view section in the left panel. Learn more about Mapping with extent or scale in ArcGIS StoryMaps and then Choreograph your maps with ArcGIS StoryMaps. Clip express map to image aspect ratio In August 2024, we announced the beta version of using an image as a base layer in express maps \u2013 and we continue to finesse this exciting feature. You will now find the option to Clip map to image aspect ratio in the express map options. By selecting this option (which is automatically selected by default when you implement an image base), the express map container will unclip from the map aspect ratio and instead clip to your image\u2019s aspect ratio. Explore Map-based images & ArcGIS StoryMaps: A treasure trove of possibilities.

After adding your images to the gallery, hover over the bottom of an image to select Options, where you will find the Caption capability. An image gallery in its non-expanded state still allows for a collective gallery caption; clicking a single image expands it within the image carousel, where individual image captions are visible.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS StoryMaps on ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 By Ellen Delgado and Priscilla Kim and Leah Jaques The ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 release brings exciting new storytelling features and enhancements to ArcGIS StoryMaps. You can now promote consistent storytelling with templates, share collection items on a map, present briefings with image gallery, code, and table blocks in full screen, and so much more. Read on to learn about the update and how it can help you elevate your storytelling! Storytelling Create templates to share storytelling patterns (beta) Enhance accessibility by adding closed captions to uploaded videos Hide the story cover Create media action text links Mapping Use an image as the base layer for an express map (beta) Add videos to express map pop-ups Choose to keep pop-ups open Display tooltips on Map tour locations Briefings Add the image gallery, code, and table blocks Collect metrics for briefings using Google or Adobe Analytics Collections Share collection items on a map (beta) Display a date on collection covers And more\u2026 Storytelling Create templates (beta) to share storytelling patterns ArcGIS StoryMaps serves as a powerful communication tool across various industries, and as a result, there is a demand for story templates. So, we are thrilled to introduce templates in the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 release of ArcGIS StoryMaps! Whether you want to provide instructions for your students to complete an assignment or save time scaling your organizational story production with consistent messaging and branding, templates are a way to create a story structure that others can follow and recreate easily. Please note that templates are only available to ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 organizations that have beta features enabled. Learn more about templates. Closed captions for uploaded videos To make ArcGIS StoryMaps more accessible, we have enabled the ability to include closed captions on uploaded videos. After uploading a video to your story, go to the Video options menu to access the new Accessibility tab and upload closed captions by adding a .vtt file. Once the file is uploaded, use the viewer controls (dependent upon web browser) to turn on captions. Learn more about closed captions and the .vtt file type in this Esri Community post, or learn more about getting started with accessible storytelling in general. Hide story cover We are excited to announce a new option in the story settings that allows you to hide the cover of a story! While this functionality has been available in specific situations, such as when adding a story to a collection or embedding it on another website, many users have expressed a desire for a more effective and streamlined method to accomplish this. The new setting will allow you to hide important details about your story from viewers. When this option is used, information can be hidden, preventing the story from appearing in web search results, so you will see that option disabled when you publish. This feature is especially useful for demonstrations or kiosks at exhibits. Add media action links to text selections Media actions allow users to create buttons that readers can click on to display different pieces of media in the sidecar block. Now, in addition to creating media action buttons, you can also configure media actions on text selections in your story. This gives you another option for creating interactive elements that are more compact and appear inline in a story paragraph. Check out this video to see link-style media actions\u2026in action. If you want to learn more about media actions, see Supercharge your stories with media actions. Mapping Upload image for express map base layer (beta) Until now, the express map builder solely offered a broad selection of basemaps and web maps to build upon using a variety of tools that can add interactivity to your map. However, with this update, you can now opt to use an image as a base layer in the express map builder. This enables you to utilize the same drawing, annotation, and dynamic map tools, plus other storytelling devices like media actions, to apply interactivity to images. Whether you are looking to guide your reader through a photo, provide further information through pop-ups, or use annotations for clarification, we\u2019re excited to see how you utilize this enhancement in your stories and briefings! Get inspired and learn more about map-based images here. Express map image base layers are in beta and only available to ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 organizations that have beta features enabled. Please let us know on the Esri Community if you find any issues or have feedback. Add videos to express map pop-ups Express maps can now provide you with a unique and efficient way to create maps for stories or briefings. With this capability, authors can elevate their express maps by adding videos to the pop-ups, enhancing the interactive experience for readers. Choose to keep pop-ups open T",
    "summary": "ArcGIS StoryMaps in ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 introduces several new storytelling features, including the ability to create templates to share storytelling patterns, add closed captions to videos for accessibility, hide story covers, and add media action links to text. Mapping enhancements allow using images as base layers in express maps, adding videos to pop-ups, keeping pop-ups open, and displaying tooltips on map tour locations. Briefings gain image gallery, code, and table blocks and can collect metrics using Google or Adobe Analytics. Collections can now display items on a map and show dates on covers.",
    "interestScore": 6,
    "rationale": "This release contains some interesting new features for ArcGIS StoryMaps, especially around templates, accessibility improvements, and new block types in briefings. The ability to use images as base layers in express maps is also a nice addition. However, most of the updates are incremental enhancements rather than major platform changes or developer-focused additions. The interest level is medium based on the scoring criteria provided.",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 07, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Urban (ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4) By Katie Thompson Earlier this year, ArcGIS Urban became available on ArcGIS Enterprise with the 11.3 release which means you can now install ArcGIS Urban on-premise in your own environment. Now with the ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 release, ArcGIS Urban has even more ways to make your plans and projects come to life in 3D with the ability to design, define, and analyze the spaces between buildings. When these new features and enhancements were first introduced in ArcGIS Urban on ArcGIS Online in June 2024, we wanted to show you what it would look like to actually use these tools in the real world. We chose Pfingstweid Park in Zurich, Switzerland, as our example\u2014a park with a rich history of adapting to the community\u2019s changing needs\u2014and redesigned some of its spaces using ArcGIS Urban. We encourage you to check out this blog to see how we did it after this quick breakdown of what\u2019s now available in ArcGIS Urban on Enterprise 11.4. Make copies of your plans and projects You can make copies of your plan to share with your coworkers or to keep track of different versions of your models. This also applies to projects. Map surfaces for parks, plazas, and green space Planning future development goes beyond the form, function, and placement of buildings. When reimagining a parcel, planners can now create and apply ground coverage using custom space-use types like grass or concrete. Define surfaces with exact dimensions Defining spaces with precision is easy with the ability to input the same dimensions as your blueprints and other architectural renderings. This added functionality also applies when sketching new boundaries for study areas, parcels, or zones. Include elevation to design with the terrain When planning spaces around buildings, you can now account for the natural contours of the land by adding elevation layers to individual plan scenarios. When you create a new ArcGIS Urban model of your community, you can also set a custom elevation to be automatically included from the start. No matter how many plans you add to your model, they will all automatically include this base elevation. Understand parcel building and surface metrics To make smart design choices, you need real data. ArcGIS Urban automatically calculates key metrics for buildings and now surfaces within a parcel, ensuring no double-counting of overlapping spaces. This helps you make sense of the interplay between the built and natural environment. See it in action For a practical approach to implementing these features, be sure to check our blog post on designing the spaces between buildings at Pfingstweid Park in Zurich, Switzerland. You can also watch this short video to see these new features in action.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Oct 30, 2024 What's New in Calcite Design System (October 2024) By Kitty Hurley and Julie Powell Learn all about the key updates in Calcite Design System that we\u2019ve recently released! Calcite enables you to build beautiful, user-friendly, and consistent experiences across applications with minimal effort. Since June, we\u2019ve made important improvements to components that facilitate responsive app development, introduced new components, and made many updates worth exploring. Read on to explore some of the highlights since June, including: Dialog Global configuration Component CSS variables List enhancements Combo box updates Slider improvements Input Time Zone usability improvements Accessibility and internationalization support Visual changes Deprecations What\u2019s next Dialog The new Dialog component presents focused interactions, tasks, or workflows to a user. Dialogs can be configured to suit a variety of use cases and interface needs, ranging from brief informational prompts to complex multi-step workflows. For instance, engaging users with onboarding or instructional content, or interrupting a workflow to present a choice or provide guidance. Some use cases of Dialog may take the form of page-blocking interactions, where the modal property should be used, and a Scrim will be positioned behind the dialog to prevent interaction with the main content. The creation of Dialog deprecates the Modal component, which is planned for removal in a future major release. The component\u2019s placement can be specified via the placement property, and offers styles where it\u2019s placement can be further customized. Dialog also offers a widthScale to specify the visual sizing, dragEnabled and resizable to drag and resize the component respectively, content slots, and provides accessibility features such as focus order and keyboard navigation. Calcite version & logging A new global variable detects and communicates the current version and provides context on component deprecations, and which major version the component is planned for removal. This can be helpful when troubleshooting an app as well as staying informed about the status of components being used by the application. You can also use calciteConfig to remove messaging from production environments and builds. To learn more, explore Global configuration in October\u2019s summary notes. Component CSS variables Calcite is working towards support of component tokens, which allow for component customization via CSS variables. Some components already offer customization for designers and developers, and additional configuration via CSS variables will be supported in future releases. Some new CSS variables available include Text Area\u2019s --calcite-text-area-min-height and --calcite-text-area-max-height, which specify the component\u2019s minimum and maximum height respectively. List enhancements List supports a filterProps property to specify which properties to filter when using filterEnabled, where one or multiple property values can be used to filter. If not set, all properties will be matched including label, description, metadata, and value. List Item includes a new unavailable property which, when enabled, makes the component\u2019s content appear disabled, while allowing users the ability to navigate to the List Item. Designers and developers can also supply additional context, such as why interaction is limited on the component. This differs from the component\u2019s disabled property, where interaction is prevented. Combobox updates Combobox Item was enhanced with description and shortHeading properties to support more workflows. Where description provides additional context to an item, and shortHeading can represent the item in a compact format when the Combobox is closed. A new content-end slot has also been introduced for adding non-actionable elements after the component\u2019s content, such as an Avatar. Additionally, Combobox\u2018s filter text value is accessible via the new filterText property. Slider improvements Slider now ensures that only integers can be selected when the snap property is true and step property is set to an integer. Input Time Zone usability improvements Input Time Zone includes multiple improvements improving its usability, such as the ability to display the region when the mode is set to \"region\" and a new search icon is added to the component\u2019s placeholder text. Accessibility and internationalization support You can shift focus to Accordion Item programmatically via the new setFocus method. Error message context for Input-based components including Combobox, Input, Select and Text Area is now provided to assistive technologies (AT) when the component\u2019s status is reported as \"invalid\". The additional context supports users that may have visual or cognitive impairments relying on AT to convey an error is present and more action is needed before form submission. Input Date Picker includes additional support for the Bosnian (bs) and Italian \u2013 Switzer",
    "summary": "The October 2024 update to the Calcite Design System introduces several key improvements and new features.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 15, 2024 What's New in ArcGIS Excalibur (Nov 2024) By Yuri Potawsky and Alexandra Wynn ArcGIS Excalibur continues to mature and this release brings several additions to provide better project management and analysis experiences. There was a particular focus on streamlining the process for getting up and running quickly with the application from an architecture and licensing standpoint. The analytics footprint has increased and the application becomes even more tightly paired within the ArcGIS web framework. Updated Architecture & Licensing for Seamless Access Excalibur has traditionally been provided as a premium add-on for ArcGIS Enterprise which required a separate installation within an ArcGIS Enterprise base deployment and an administrator assigning the application to a named user. At the Enterprise 11.4 release, Excalibur is now an embedded application that requires no additional installation. In addition, as per the user type changes in June of this year, ArcGIS Excalibur is included with the Creator and above user types. This means you can get up and running quickly without the need to install the application or assign an add-on license because user types leverage the named user model in the wider ArcGIS system. The Excalibur Project Increases Collaboration with New Support for Contextual Layers The Excalibur project continues to grow in functionality and extends an already rich set of supporting tools. Excalibur projects provide a dynamic way to organize all the resources required for an image or video-based task. They promote collaboration across an organization by enabling analysts to conduct focused, ready-to-use workflows aimed at creating content from imagery and video. It now supports the ability to add layers from an authenticated Portal which brings the utility of adding contextual or supporting supplemental layers into the project. In addition, there is now support for the ArcGIS WebMap enabling existing maps to be consumed as well as authoring of new maps all within the confines of the project. Enhanced Analytics Through Use of Image Chips and Attachments There has been a significant effort to extend the observation collection experience. Observation collection has a variety of use cases but is well suited for remote inspections or pattern detection. It essentially allows you to capture feature data with the corresponding attributes from supporting layers or focus imagery that are posted into an authoritative system of record. An addition at the November 2024 release allows the user to capture image chips (small defined images) that are added into the feature layer as an attachment. This now enables an Excalibur user to extract imagery observations for a series of images over time and provides attachments for downstream analysis within ArcGIS. In addition, Excalibur has a new tool that will create a web application experience around these attachments. This is an iteration of the Attachment Viewer Instant App and is created and published into the Portal. Additions to Publishing: Easily Add Geospatial Context to Videos Frequently users capture video that do not contain the metadata required for geospatial awareness. When publishing video layers through the Excalibur publishing tools, key location details can be defined. Users can now leverage geolocated videos in their GIS by manually adding location data, expanding the range of videos that can be accurately displayed on a map.

Presentations provide a new way to brief maps, images, videos, and more to disseminate information while in the application. ArcGIS Workflow Manager is a management system focused on automating and simplifying GIS and non-GIS workflows. It allows for the management of people, tools, and processes across your organization. In addition to these new functionalities, there are also improvements to a plethora of geoprocessing tools, functions, and commands. Presentations Presenting mission information to stakeholders can often feel disconnected when analysts must move project information from ArcGIS AllSource into other applications designed for presentation. With Presentations, this process no longer feels disconnected. This tool allows analysts to conduct briefs within a project and disseminate information to key stakeholders in the same application used for doing the analysis. When creating a presentation, the Contents pane and Map view update to bring focus on the presentation. After creating a presentation, you can begin customizing each page of the presentation by clicking Insert Page. This will prompt the Insert New Page pane to appear. Now users can create a presentation adding maps, images, videos, or text on pages that are dynamic and descriptive visualization products. Once you have finished your presentation you can view it in Full Screen mode, using the left and right arrows to move through your presentation as you brief. Workflow Manager To non-GIS professionals using ArcGIS AllSource, the various geoprocessing tools, commands, and operations can feel overwhelming. It becomes increasingly difficult when senior analysts and junior analysts work together on the same mission, but on different shifts. Workflow Manager addresses this by allowing mission leads and senior analysts to create a standardized workflow for an organization to follow and learn. Workflow Manager is designed using two main components that work in tandem: the Workflow Manager web application and the Workflow Manager pane in the desktop application After creating a workflow item, you can use the web application to begin designing your workflow to your organization\u2019s mission goal and standard. Once you have finished designing a workflow item, you can share it with others in your organization by saving the workflow on the web application and opening it through your portal in ArcGIS AllSource. Once connected to your workflow item, you can begin your analysis and work through the designed steps. Workflow Manager brings standardization to an organization and allows senior analysts to manage and coach, even when time or shifts don\u2019t allow it.

    "date": "2024-11-20",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 20, 2024 What's New for Spatial Analyst in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 By Juan Laguna The Spatial Analyst extension introduces new and enhanced capabilities in ArcGIS Pro 3.4. This release gives you new tools for surface and zonal analysis as well as improved capabilities for density and distance analysis. Several tools for hydrology analysis have improved performance. Some new help content is available for solar analysis. Read on to learn more. Where to get it? ArcGIS Pro 3.4 was released in November 7, 2024. Download from here For an overview of the changes that have been made for this release, have a look at the ArcGIS Pro Update (November 2024) blog post and video. What\u2019s changed for Spatial Analyst? Here are the primary areas of improvements over the last release: Density analysis Distance analysis Hydrology analysis Solar analysis Surface analysis Zonal analysis 1. Density analysis The Space Time Kernel Density tool can now create an output voxel layer. This output represents the density of the input points as magnitude per-unit-area across multidimensional space and time. What does that mean? You can now interactively explore the results as a 3D volumetric visualization! Have a look at the following screenshot for an example of what you can do with this new capability. The output must be a netCDF raster, which you create by specifying \u201c.nc\u201d as the filename extension for the Output Raster parameter. Some new Usages help guide you through the process of creating the voxel layer and adding it to a scene. We also improved some of the parameter descriptions for the tool, as well as the How Space Time Kernel Density works help topic. 2. Distance analysis Around the world distance: Do you perform distance analysis at a global extent? Several tools can now calculate least cost paths around the entire world! The Distance Accumulation, Distance Allocation, Optimal Path as Line, and Optimal Path as Raster tools no longer treat the edge of the map as a barrier. This improvement is available when the Distance Method parameter is set to Geodesic, and the data is in either a geographic coordinate system or a cylindrical projection. Zero or negative values for Cost Distance: A usability improvement for distance tools that can use a Cost raster as an optional input. These tools are: Distance Accumulation, Distance Allocation, Optimal Corridor Connections, and Optimal Region Connections. Since the cumulative cost algorithm is a multiplicative process, calculating accumulative cost correctly is problematic if any cost values are zero or negative. In earlier releases, the tools processed cells with these values as NoData. Now, the tools treat these values as very small positive values. This allows the use of Cost rasters that contain cells of zero or negative values directly in workflows, without having to remove them in a pre-processing step. Raster Functions: The same update to handle the edge of the projection at a global extent as the corresponding geoprocessing tools was applied to the raster functions: Distance Accumulation, Distance Allocation, and Optimal Path As Raster. For the Distance Accumulation and Distance Allocation raster functions, the Vertical Factor parameter now includes Hiking Time and Bidirectional Hiking Time options. This matches the the options that were added to the equivalent geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro 3.3. 3. Hydrology analysis For hydrology analysis, we made notable performance improvements to the Basin, Flow Length, Snap Pour Point, and Stream Order tools. A future blog post will cover in more detail the types of gains achieved by these tools. 4. Solar analysis Do you use the Raster Solar Radiation and Feature Solar Radiation tools in Spatial Analyst? We added several new help topics to better explain how to use these tools. The Analyze solar radiation topic provides some general information on solar radiation is calculated for a surface on the Earth or the Moon. To learn more about using these tools and how the calculations are performed, read the How Feature Solar Radiation works and How Raster Solar Radiation works topics. 5. Surface analysis Three new geoprocessing tools are available for performing surface analysis. One application for these tools is to extract and evaluate information about elevation-derived hydrography directly in ArcGIS Pro in a more integrated and seamless workflow than was previously possible. Feature Preserving Smoothing The Feature Preserving Smoothing tool smooths out a surface raster by removing small scale surface variation (noise), while preserving the meaningful landscape features. It has several parameters that gives control over the amount and type of smoothing you want to apply. Multiscale Surface Difference and Multiscale Surface Percentile Two new tools identify specific landscape characteristics of a surface raster at multiple scales. In this context, the different scales represent different neighborhood distances from each input ",

    "date": "2024-11-05",
    "content": "Public Safety November 5, 2024 As Waters Rise, Maps Guide Louisiana in Restoring a Crumbling Coastline By Ryan Lanclos The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) in Louisiana utilizes GIS technology to support its vital mission in the face of increasing climate change pressures. Key Takeaways CPRA uses GIS to plan and prioritize coastal restoration projects. Analysts run sophisticated hydrology projection models to understand future impacts. GIS is used to manage the logistics of moving sediment to stabilize coastal landscapes and protect infrastructure from storm surges. Louisiana is sinking into the sea. Or rather, the sea is engulfing Louisiana. Both are true; the combination of sea level rise, subsidence, and land degradation has claimed 2,000 square miles of coastline in the state. Since 1932, a landmass the size of Delaware has slipped under the Gulf of Mexico. Following the brutal one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the State of Louisiana created the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) and tasked it with safeguarding communities from the grim circumstances of rising waters. Projects include restoring barrier islands and marshes, constructing flood protection systems, and implementing coastal land-building techniques. Tackling the big questions involved in land-loss mitigation is a responsibility that falls on CPRA\u2019s team of coastal scientists, project managers, and engineers. The team includes Eric White, a research engineer specializing in hydrology projection models; and Rocky Wager, a senior coastal resources scientist with extensive geographic information systems (GIS) expertise. And the big questions include these: Where would be the safest locations to build the infrastructure? How much will it cost? What is the cost of inaction? Geographic Data Holds the Answers To predict the impact of rising sea levels on the Louisiana coast, CPRA has modeled potential coastlines 50 years into the future. Projections depict varying scenarios, each contingent on the completion of specific project proposals. The models help answer important questions: What does the coastline look like if the new levees aren\u2019t built? How will building marshland impact the economy of this parish? These models factor into the types of projects CPRA pursues. Decisions are codified in the Coastal Master Plan, which guides the work of the agency. The plan is updated every six years, most recently in 2023. Projects are backed primarily by disaster relief funding, which means that the money to build tends to fluctuate based on catastrophic events. Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, for example, about $15 billion in funding was made available from legal settlements, fines, and penalties, and $8.2 billion of that funding was dedicated to Louisiana. Every time a major storm hits\u2014which has been about once every two or three years\u2014the state receives finances to rebuild and harden the coastline. \u201cThis idea of having a master plan is so that we are ready when funding becomes available,\u201d White said from his office in Baton Rouge. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this foundational work to set our priorities and do the initial triage of knowing what to go after.\u201d There are hundreds of potential projects that CPRA could create to lessen the effects of sea level rise, which is one of several tipping points the world\u2019s coastal communities face. Strategies include nature-based solutions, such as marsh restoration, and hard infrastructure, such as levees and sea walls. Leveraging GIS applications, CPRA can effectively map historical, current, and future coastal conditions. This enables the testing of intervention scenarios within GIS, which assists in prioritizing efforts to vulnerable coastal areas. The adoption of model-based GIS approaches have proved to be successful, offering optimal solutions to address Louisiana\u2019s worsening coastal crisis. In Louisiana, community input plays a significant role in the plan framework. Concepts are solicited from the public and members of advisory groups to address key coastal concerns. These groups consist of local officials, community leaders, scientists, and residents who provide input on the challenges and priorities of their respective regions. \u201cAll the complexities of our coast\u2014the small waterways, bayous, ridges, and levee system\u2014they could navigate it on a boat in the dark,\u201d White said of community-led collaborators and their depth of knowledge. \u201cSometimes people mail in drawings of changes they want to see, or areas of concern.\u201d Digitizing and georeferencing proposals with GIS technology is often the first step of analysis. Then, CPRA uses geographic data to make cost projections. Land cover dictates the materials and structures the organization will build. Existing elevation determines the volume of material that is needed. Sediment density indicates the amount of dredging required. The distance between dredging sources and project areas impacts the project cost. S",

GIS enables CPRA to model future coastlines, test intervention scenarios, and make data-driven decisions on where to build protective infrastructure like levees and restore marshlands. The agency works with partners like USGS to collect and manage geospatial data in the Coastal Information Management System (CIMS). This data, along with community input, guides the state's Coastal Master Plan which is updated every 6 years.

    "content": "Infrastructure November 7, 2024 Needleseye Park: GIS Helped Forge this Climbing Spot from Discovery to Construction By Adam Carnow Employees in Oak Hill, West Virginia, are using maps, imagery, and mobile apps to track the development and organization of Needleseye Park, providing stakeholders with greater transparency about the park\u2019s progress. Key Takeaways When Oak Hill, West Virginia annexed the town of Minden, it acquired 300 acres of undeveloped land. Detailed lidar data showed the cliffs and boulders, prompting city officials to develop the land into a recreational spot. From initial discovery through park development, GIS technology aided in creating an inventory of natural features, securing funding, and designing and developing the park. Nestled among West Virginia\u2019s rolling hills, Needleseye Park is a 300-acre recreational haven. Ancient boulders, towering cliffs, and scenic trails weave through verdant forests, inviting outdoor enthusiasts from all corners of the country to hike, bike, and seek adventure. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. For most of the 20th century, an Appalachian-based land management company known for its mining operations owned the land. The ownership of this land concealed its climbing potential from all but a small group of locals and early explorers who had discovered the climbing opportunities at Needleseye. The park\u2019s formal development trace back to 2015 when the City of Oak Hill annexed the neighboring town of Minden and redrew its map. That\u2019s when Marvin Davis, Oak Hill\u2019s geographic information system (GIS) coordinator at the time, noticed something special. On a 3D map informed by lidar data, Davis saw an impressive two-mile series of boulders and cliffs that looked perfect for outdoor recreation. The map caught the attention of key stakeholders, including City Manager Bill Hannabass who called for an on-the-ground exploration. That exploration eventually led to the acquisition and development of what is now Needleseye Park. From the first 3D map through data gathering and planning, the Oak Hill team has been guided by GIS technology. \u201cGIS helped make Needleseye a reality from the start,\u201d Davis said. Visualizing What Needleseye Park Could Be Before exploring the idea of creating a park, the city needed a system to record survey trips and share the information. So, Davis created a mapping solution using the city\u2019s enterprise GIS technology. \u201cIt encouraged collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could share data with multiple stakeholders to get their buy-in and secure funding.\u201d Davis, Hannabass, and their teams collected field data and photographs for various park features, including cliffs, boulders, crags, and a cave. This data, layered on a GIS map, supported planning discussions. They worked with community experts such as professional climbers to determine suitable trails, rate the difficulty of climbing routes, and scout locations for trailheads and facilities. Davis also created a geospatial digital twin, a digital replica of the park that can support planning and operations. The digital twin helped Oak Hill secure funding to conserve the park through the West Virginia Land Trust. Foundational Tools for Park Construction Needleseye Park opened to the public in 2019 and is still a work in progress. But Tyler Bragg, the City of Oak Hill\u2019s GIS coordinator, said geospatial technologies are supporting nearly every aspect of the park\u2019s development. Bragg and Josh Sapio, Oak Hill\u2019s inaugural Parks and Recreation director, have been utilizing GIS tools to gather data and oversee development. Each week, they collect data from contractors about the work they have completed. The team then use a GIS data collection app and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to record the exact location and details of new trail segments. This data flows into a GIS dashboard almost immediately, allowing all stakeholders to monitor trail construction progress. The streamlined process helps ensure contractors are adhering to project timelines. The team also uses GIS to verify data in the contractors\u2019 reports, recording what each contractor is owed for features such as rock armor and retaining walls. The Needleseye Trails Construction Tracker gives stakeholders a comprehensive view of ongoing work. A stormwater inspection app was created with ArcGIS Survey123 to evaluate any issues of trail damage or erosion after a storm. Climbers must fill out a survey form when proposing new climbing routes at Needleseye Park, with data going to city employees to evaluate the request. Part of the park\u2019s construction management involves stormwater inspection surveys every four days or after every quarter inch of rainfall. Bragg digitized the process using ArcGIS Survey123, a mobile survey tool. The survey includes details such as inspector names, site addresses, and inspection types. Once the survey is completed, the app automatically generates and shares a report. \u201cIf I can save somebody 10 minutes in t",

    "content": "Public Safety November 12, 2024 Afghanistan: Geospatial Analysis Conveys Current Conditions Under the Taliban By Olivier Cottray Alcis has uncovered illicit economies and the movement of drugs in Afghanistan for 20 years, using GIS and satellite imagery analysis. Key Takeaways Alcis analysts reveal changes in agricultural production in Afghanistan. Maps rich with imagery and data help analysts determine the winners and losers from changes in policy and climate. Armed with insightful maps, aid organizations reach those in need in remote regions. When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, one of its first policies was to ban poppy cultivation. The halt in a trade so intertwined with the country\u2019s economy was bound to affect its most vulnerable people. Richard Brittan, managing director of the geospatial analysis firm Alcis, got to work creating a clear picture of the humanitarian impact. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) technology, Alcis\u2019s analysis could tell the stories of human suffering and political instability to support aid efforts. Through maps and data, analysts could monitor key factors including changes in crops and the movement of migrants to Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re in this rapidly evolving space where the use of spatial tools and open-source intelligence shows the dynamics of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Brittan said. \u201cAs the volume and resolution of spatial data has increased, we can get really powerful insights.\u201d Alcis has 20 years of experience in Afghanistan and has worked in many other complex, fragile regions of the world\u2014collecting data, delivering information products, and consulting on policy. Its clients include national governments, international agencies, banks, private businesses, and the United Nations. Understanding the Needs of a Population In places such as Afghanistan, where the chaos of conflict forces frequent relocation, it\u2019s difficult to find an accurate map of where people live. Since 2017, more than 1.5 million Afghans have been internally displaced. Over the past 50 years, 7 million Afghans have migrated to other countries. Alcis uses GIS, imagery, and input from residents to map the current conditions impacting the people and economies of countries in conflict or recovering from it. An elevated view of the Bamiyan Valley of Afghanistan reveals a variety of crops under cultivation. Opium poppy flowers next to wheat fields near Faizabad, Afghanistan. Afghan police officers destroying opium poppy flowers fields near Faizabad, Afghanistan. GIS provides a portrait of the situation, with workflows to reveal where people are vulnerable and who has advantages. The formula considers factors including population density, crop health, who farms higher-value orchards and vineyards, number of livestock, whether lights are on at night, the distance to roads and markets, and access to healthcare or education. With this information, aid organizations can see where to respond and learn who needs the most assistance. Alcis delivers insights to humanitarian groups such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Food Programme. Drilling into the Details Location-based analysis also revealed interesting trends in Afghanistan\u2019s water usage and poppy production. Water scarcity is a cause for concern in the desert region, with the potential for widespread displacement of people if groundwater is depleted. Alcis uncovered a trend of farmers using solar-powered pumps to pull water from the aquifer beneath the desert in southwest corner of the country, with more than 100,000 reservoirs popping up since 2022. \u201cThis is just one house pulling water to irrigate those crops,\u201d Brittan said, pointing at the features on a map. \u201cThe dark green is opium poppy; this is wheat.\u201d Desert land in Helmund Province is now being cultivated with water drawn from wells. (Image courtesy of Alcis) Afghan farmers use solar panels to pump water into reservoirs. (Image courtesy of Alcis) Alcis plotted the growth of reservoirs across the desert in Southwest corner of Afghanistan. (Map courtesy of Alcis) Data showed that many of the farmers do not own the land. So, Alcis determined the most marginalized are growing poppy there, pulling water they need now, but without long-term stewardship of the land. For its water tracking effort, Alcis has been mapping the causes and effects. Drought conditions have lowered the water table, forcing subsistence farmers to dig deeper. Conflicts over water cross over into Iran as well, erupting in violence among those living near the border. \u201cIf there\u2019s canal runoff here, with agricultural productivity increases, you\u2019re going to have downstream consequences on people here,\u201d Brittan said, pointing at the map. \u201cWhat happens when the water goes dry? Nearly 2 million people will be on the move.\u201d This ability to surface tipping points for aid organizations helps them anticipate changing needs. When weather patterns change or re",

    "content": "Public Safety November 19, 2024 Key Bridge: Cross-Agency Collaboration Quickly Reopens Baltimore Shipping Channel By Ryan Lanclos and Chris Oxendine and Carl Walter An aerial view of the wreckage before 50,000 tons of debris were removed. (Photo by Alejandro Rivera courtesy of the US Coast Guard) [Editor\u2019s Note: The appearance of US Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.] The Key Bridge collapse on March 26, 2024, caused by the cargo ship Dali, led to significant disruptions at the Port of Baltimore that required a coordinated all-government response to restore port access efficiently, setting a benchmark for future emergency management. Key Takeaways The Key Bridge collapse severed access to the Port of Baltimore, disrupting global supply chains and triggering economic losses. Federal agencies, led by the US Coast Guard, coordinated a rapid response using a GIS-powered common operating picture. Collaborative efforts across federal, state, and local governments minimized long-term impact on port operations. In the early hours of March 26, 2024, the cargo ship Dali crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, severing the main span and sending massive steel girders crashing into the Patapsco River. Eight bridge maintenance workers fell into the water and only two survived. The bridge sits at a vulnerable pinch point\u2014spanning a narrow channel where large ships enter the Port of Baltimore, the ninth-busiest US port. In the days and weeks following the incident that forced a closure of the port, global supply chains and port revenue suffered. The US Department of Labor estimated that 270,000 workers were directly or indirectly impacted. Estimates calculated a daily cost of $192 million in economic activity. However, the port\u2019s strategic location facilitated a swift response. Proximity to the US capital meant oversight by leaders of federal agencies and the White House. Additionally, being on the busy East Coast meant quick access to necessary equipment and personnel. Responding agencies each connected their enterprise geographic information system (GIS) to the others\u2019 to seamlessly share web maps, web services, 3D scenes, and other data. Within just six days, a new channel was opened for shallow-draft vessels. By the 30-day mark, half the channel\u2019s width was cleared, allowing deep-draft vessels to pass. In 76 days, the original channel was fully restored. \u201cBy working together, we turned months into weeks\u2014and bounced back faster than many could have ever anticipated,\u201d Governor Wes Moore of Maryland said in a statement. Supporting Individual Roles for Cross-Agency Collaboration In the first 24 hours of the bridge collision and collapse, first responders focused on a search and rescue mission. Then, the US Coast Guard, which oversees waterways and bridges that span navigation routes, took the lead. Its Marine Transportation System Recovery Unit started working to reopen the Port of Baltimore as quickly as possible. \u201cAt the start, we pulled together bridge blueprints from the 1970s. By the third day, we built a GIS dashboard to focus on creating new channels,\u201d said Lt. Commander Ian Hanna, lead of the Coast Guard\u2019s Response GIS Support Team. \u201cWe knew it was going to be a while for the main channel to reopen.\u201d The Coast Guard set up a Unified Command Center at the Maryland Cruise Terminal. They added all key data to a real-time GIS dashboard, including vessel locations provided by Esri partner Spire. This dashboard became the center\u2019s common operating picture, with a constant flow of new inputs to keep all stakeholders informed. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) incorporated sensor data from buoys, which monitor water currents, and depth data from multibeam sonar surveys to update nautical charts. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) added bathymetric channel surveys to monitor changes as pieces of the bridge were removed. Personnel and data from the Maryland Transportation Authority, the City of Baltimore, and other state agencies joined the effort. Soon, the individual agencies wanted to create their own purpose-built apps to coordinate missions and feed updates into the common operating picture. Amilynn Adams, a marine transportation system specialist with the Coast Guard, built a site with ArcGIS Hub to connect vital data and share the purpose-built apps from each agency. \u201cThe first 72 hours, everybody was sending me data over email,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cI was spending all night processing that and then posting it onto the dashboard. It was not sustainable.\u201d \u201cWe set up a call with the Army Corps, NOAA, and others on how we wanted to share data,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe created a partnered collaboration group, with restricted access. We were all seasoned on data sharing details surrounding natural disasters and what that means in terms of data governance.\u201d With portal-to-portal GIS connections, each agency maintained full contr",

    "content": "Emerging Technologies November 5, 2024 A New Type of Price Check Gains Ground By Mark Dann The Esri Brief Trending insights from WhereNext and other leading publications Not only is there no such thing as a free lunch\u2014it\u2019s more expensive than you think. We know this because of a practice called true cost accounting, which puts a price tag on food\u2019s environmental toll and may be nearing a breakout moment in the business world. Snapshot: Retail experiments, massive purchasing decisions: true cost accounting is in the spotlight, and may land on the executive agenda next. As a recent New York Times article explained, beef that costs $5 per pound in the supermarket has a true cost of $22. The extra $17 is mostly the toll for ecosystem damage caused by cattle farming. Other costs measured by true cost accounting include water stress, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. A thorough assessment of true cost involves more than just dollar figures. It starts with an understanding of where products come from and how much value nature provides to a given location. If true cost accounting finds its place in purchase decisions and regulatory frameworks, transparency and operational visibility into the supply chain will be essential. A geographic approach to operations will help businesses adapt. Regulatory Compliance and True Cost Accounting Related Read: // Three companies on how they account for nature True cost accounting is not a new concept. A 2021 Rockefeller Foundation report pegged the true cost of food in the US at three times the $1.1 trillion Americans spend on it annually. Recently, the theory has begun to move into practice: A German supermarket chain now applies true cost accounting when setting prices on select products. A coffee house in the Netherlands partnered with the Dutch government and private vendors to charge \u201creal prices\u201d reflecting hidden environmental and social costs. In the UK, the Ministry of Agriculture, four supermarket chains, and the National Farmers Union have collaborated to develop the global farm metric, a data-based measurement of food inputs and impacts. Governments are now considering true cost accounting\u2014or elements of it\u2014in regulatory and purchasing decisions. Denmark levies a tax on methane gas emitted by some farm animals. The state of New York may soon direct its agencies to use true cost accounting for food procurement decisions, including with school lunch vendors. Companies involved in all stages of production, from growing and processing to transport and retail, will feel the ripple effects of these decisions. New York\u2019s state agencies alone account for one out of every thousand dollars spent on food in the US. Mapping Cost in Tiers Already, companies routinely create digital basemaps of their operations, using geographic information system (GIS) technology. A GIS map can include multiple data layers, each detailing variables affecting the true cost of a product. By showing where costs are incurred, companies gain a better understanding of how they accrue. Consider a company that sells tomato-based products like ketchup and pasta sauce. To assess products\u2019 true costs, analysts might gather data on how much water each supplier farm uses, along with their rates of fertilizer or pesticides and the emissions generated by trucks during distribution. Those maps, featured on a GIS dashboard, give executives, product managers, pricing analysts, sustainability teams, and compliance managers a new level of product accounting. Computing the True Costs of Development True cost accounting aims to measure the environmental impacts\u2014such as deforestation, water stress, emissions, and species loss\u2014of activities like mining, construction, and food production. It\u2019s part of a broader movement. A new UK law requires that all new building projects not only preserve existing biodiversity, but demonstrate a 10 percent net gain. Meeting those requirements means understanding the natural conditions in specific locations and measuring progress over time. Maps have been key to visualizing sustainability goals in similar scenarios. A massive development project in Vienna, for example, uses a GIS-based digital twin to ensure that the construction process adheres to climate-related requirements. Across a range of industries\u2014from infrastructure development to manufacturing to agriculture\u2014companies are facing calls to quantify their footprint on the natural world. True cost accounting is the latest practice to demand this kind of location awareness, but with climate change in focus, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 08, 2024 Oriented Imagery: Frequently Asked Questions By Emily Windahl Updated November 2024 The oriented imagery capability of ArcGIS enables you to manage, visualize, and explore a wider array of image types in the context of a map, including collections of high oblique drone images, close-range inspection images, street-level images, and images taken by mobile devices. First integrated into the October 2023 release of ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro 3.2, and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2, you can now seamlessly bring these new imagery formats into your GIS. Learn more about what\u2019s new in oriented imagery: ArcGIS Pro 3.4, ArcGIS Online (November 2024), & ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4: visualize 360 imagery in Pro, overlay feature layers in imagery in Online, and create 3D oriented imagery web apps ArcGIS Online (February 2024): visualize 360 imagery, create an oriented imagery app, ArcGIS QuickCapture support ArcGIS Online (October 2023), ArcGIS Pro 3.2, and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2: the initial release of the oriented imagery capability Read on to learn more about\u2026 How the oriented imagery capability fits into the ArcGIS system Troubleshooting the oriented imagery workflow in ArcGIS Transitioning from Oriented Imagery Classic to the integrated oriented imagery capability Do you have questions we haven\u2019t answered here? Visit us at the Esri Community page for Oriented Imagery and share your thoughts. The big picture Learn more about what the oriented imagery capability is and how it fits into the ArcGIS system. What are \u201coriented images\u201d? Oriented images are images with associated location, orientation, and camera metadata that are used to relate pixels in an image to locations on a map (and vice versa). This includes images that can\u2019t be rectified using traditional photogrammetric solutions, like street-level images, images from mobile devices, close-range inspection images, and high oblique images. (It can also include nadir and low oblique images, though those can also be managed, visualized and analyzed in ArcGIS using existing methods). Oriented imagery can include images collected from many different kinds of platforms with a variety of view angles, including drones, airplanes, terrestrial vehicles (like cars or buses), handheld devices, or even tripods. Is oriented imagery a part of ArcGIS Reality? Both the oriented imagery capability and ArcGIS Reality products generate accurate digital representations of the real world using images and geospatial data, also known as \u201creality mapping.\u201d However, they serve different purposes, which can sometimes be used jointly. With ArcGIS Reality, you can create authoritative 2D and 3D data products, such as True Orthos and 3D meshes, at virtually any scale. These products are generated from large collections of overlapping still images captured by drones, airplanes or satellites. Sometimes you don\u2019t need a True Ortho or 3D data products, or you already have them. Perhaps the images you have aren\u2019t captured with the necessary overlap required to process them using ArcGIS Reality. Or, you need only a few images and want to view them in their full original resolution. The oriented imagery capability provides the ability to manage, query, and visualize collections of individual images (overlapping or not), captured indoors, from the ground, or from the air, and visualize those individual images in geospatial context. Used together, they can provide an extremely detailed view of what\u2019s happening on the ground, supporting inspection and providing you remote intelligence about areas or objects of interest so you can make informed decisions. I have drone imagery\u2014when should I use oriented imagery? Oriented imagery might be a good option for visualizing your drone images if your imagery collection doesn\u2019t support the block adjustment required to generate products with ArcGIS Reality. This could mean an image collection that: Contains images that include the horizon (or are angled up above the horizon) Doesn\u2019t contain enough images or the images don\u2019t have enough overlap Contains images that are very close up (like for inspections) In these cases, the oriented imagery capability provides an alternative to orthorectification for relating the images to the map/ground. It uses information like the location and orientation of the camera, the camera\u2019s horizontal and vertical fields of view, and a digital elevation model (DEM) that defines the ground to relate each pixel in an image to a location on a map (and vice versa). Instead of visualizing the images directly on a map, the user clicks on a point of interest on the map, then views the best image of that location in the oriented imagery viewer, with the image\u2019s footprint dynamically updated on the map as the user pans and zooms in the image. Additionally, you may want to supplement your ArcGIS Reality products with oriented images\u2014for example, to document small changes that don\u2019t warrant re-processing your",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 18, 2024 GIS at the Speed of Life By Tom Sweet Imagery enables real-time insights We live in a visual world that is vibrant and dynamic. From the moment we awaken, our brains automatically start processing everything we see. Imagery plays a crucial role in this process because it\u2019s the primary way we perceive and interact with the world around us. Before we\u2019ve even pulled back the covers or set our feet on the floor, we\u2019re already processing in 2D, 3D, and even 4D. Instantly, we begin to benefit from the intelligence provided by the data in the objects we see, such as color and dimensions like width and length (aka 2D or x & y). But our brains aren\u2019t finished processing just yet. We automatically process the images we see, adding depth and distance instantly awakening our spatial understanding abilities (aka 3D or x, y,& z). Imagery is not just about what we see; it\u2019s about how we interpret and understand our environment, making it a vital component of our daily experiences and interactions. Even before we\u2019re fully aware, our intuition kicks in, providing rapid, subconscious insights into changes over time\u2014this is the realm of 4D perception. Ever experienced that moment when you glance at something and instantly know that something\u2019s different? That\u2019s your brain processing temporal changes in the environment, all before you\u2019ve even had your first sip of coffee. Truly, imagery is foundational to how we navigate and make sense of the world. There is power in using imagery. Our innate ability to perceive and interpret visual data isn\u2019t just a fascinating aspect of human cognition; it\u2019s a powerful tool that, when amplified by technology, can revolutionize how we understand and interact with our world. Remotely sensed imagery, captured from cell phones, traffic cameras, drones, aircraft, satellites and much more, provides unprecedented views of our planet, enabling us to monitor and analyze changes \u2013 theoretically even in real-time. This constant stream of visual data is transforming industries and driving innovation. In the following paragraphs, we\u2019ll explore how remotely sensed imagery is being harnessed to create Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that operate at the speed of life. By seamlessly integrating and analyzing up-to-the-minute imagery, these dynamic systems empower us to address real-world challenges with precision and agility, shaping a more responsive and resilient future. Let\u2019s dive in and discover the transformative power of imagery in the realm of GIS. Remotely sensed imagery opens up the art of the possible Building upon the foundation of remotely sensed content, we can establish a comprehensive philosophy and framework for the entire lifecycle of imagery combined with real-time sensors. This approach is optimally a locally independent, regionally coordinated process that treats all data as interconnected assets essential for governance or any sector-specific needs. This philosophy establishes and maintains repeatable processes that include defining the applications to be served, planning the capture of necessary data, acquiring the data, organizing, storing, and cataloging the data, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data, applying and publishing the data to gain knowledge and wisdom for informed, dynamic, and sustainable action, and archiving the data to make way for newer data, repeating the process. By leveraging imagery as our foundation and integrating all essential data, we activate near real-time situational awareness within an interactive digital model. This isn\u2019t merely about observing the present; it\u2019s about anticipating and molding the future. Using the video below we can delve into what\u2019s possible when we have an imagery foundation, in this case harvested properly from a satellite so we could process to present a resilient 3D representation of our reality using a gaming engine. Now we can bring it all together and: Track Transportation in Real-Time: Tap into our knowledge of transportation schedules and current location and travel variables to reveal that an incoming train is running 23 minutes late. If additional data were available, we could also utilize it to determine capacity and identify who will be affected by the delay. Monitor Service Disruptions: We identify the start of an evolving situation where 38 people have lost essential services such as electricity, internet, or water. Keep Public Transportation on Schedule: We note that bus number 70 is now 2 but stretching to 19 minutes late, impacting public transportation timetables. Stay Ahead of Weather Alerts: We receive a weather alert for a departing watercraft, ensuring timely and safe navigation. Respond to Unfolding Incidents: We detect an incident affecting train ZH26. Perhaps we deploy drone-in-a-box functionality for first responders to enhance their response capabilities. Lets shape a responsive, resilient world together. Just think! What could be accomplished if",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 12, 2024 Enhanced Data Management Supports Automated Intelligence Workflows (Part 2) By Keara Mclean In defense and intelligence, swift and accurate data interpretation is vital. Effective data management turns raw information into actionable intelligence, which is crucial for high-stakes decisions. This blog explores how to automate analytics workflows in real-time for more informed and timely actions in critical missions. In case you missed it, check out Part 1 of this blog for a deep dive into how to leverage data management with ArcGIS Web Apps in intelligence workflows. Maintain situational awareness with real-time data This process of automated data ingestion can be applied to data feeds from a variety of sources and sensors, including real-time datasets. Analysts can be alerted of events as they happen, supporting more immediate and informed action by decision-makers. Using authoritative datasets that have been conditioned and made available throughout our ArcGIS Organization, we built a dashboard and configured it to monitor the tense maritime situation in the South China Sea. Focusing on our primary area of interest, the Janes Global Event data displayed in the dashboard elements reveals that military tensions between China and Taiwan dominate this subregion. The majority of significant events occur in the Taiwan Strait, a highly contested area marked by disputed territories on our map. Given the close physical proximity of these feuding governments, it is imperative to maintain persistent awarenessof maritime activities in the area, particularly for suspicious shipping movements. Automate filtering for focused analysis ArcGIS enables seamless integration with external systems and data sources, such as Spire\u2019s real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship tracking API, which allows us to monitor global maritime activity, apply real-time analytics, and filter data relevant to our mission. Connecting to Spire\u2019s maritime API with ArcGIS Velocity, we used filters to focus on vessels that have been associated with illicit activities, such as fishing vessels potentially linked to China\u2019s Dark Fleet. This targeted approach declutters our operating picture, allowing us to concentrate analytic efforts on the most pertinent information. On our dashboard, we visualized this real-time shipping data filtered to display only vessels of interest. This streamlined view allows users to quickly assess the maritime landscape and respond to emerging threats. Inform response workflows with alert-based analytics To enhance our monitoring capabilities, we configured a real-time analytic in ArcGIS Velocity that sends an alert to notify analysts when a Chinese-flagged vessel enters restricted waters and, crucially, when it stops transmitting its location. Because AIS is a safety-of-life-at-sea (SOLAS) signal, a vessel going dark can be an indicator of potential illicit activity. We can see the analytic in action around Kinmen County, a series of islands off the coast of China that are owned and operated by Taiwan. Here, a simulated vessel meeting our criteria moves eastward toward a disputed area. As the vessel approaches the restricted zone, its status changes, triggering an alert via the ArcGIS Velocity analytic. Upon entering the restricted area, the vessel slows down and eventually stops transmitting its location. This event activates a visual notification on our dashboard, indicating that the vessel has gone dark. Streamline intelligence workflows with human-machine teaming Traditionally, responding to such alerts would involve a complex series of workflows requiring significant time and coordination among multiple analysts. For instance, an analyst might need to conduct a Farthest on Circle analysis to predict the vessel\u2019s potential movement patterns, search through an image catalog for recent imagery, and analyze that imagery to identify the vessel. We\u2019ve automated the entire response process using various elements of the ArcGIS system. When the vessel goes dark, it triggers a webhook that initiates a Notebook to take the last known location, perform a Farthest on Circle analysis, retrieve the most recent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and detect ships within that imagery. The resulting details are compiled and sent via email to decision-makers and imagery analysts, including a link to ready-to-verify results. Analysts can then focus on validating the results in ArcGIS Excalibur, streamlining the process from receiving an alert to confirming vessel locations. While this doesn\u2019t yet confirm that these detected vessels are definitively our dark ship, our dashboard updates automatically to reflect the verification status of results, minimizing the latency of information being pushed back to decision makers and providing an up-to-date picture of the situation. This integration of automation and real-time analytics significantly reduces the cognitive load on analysts while ",

Effective data management enables the transformation of raw information into actionable intelligence, which is crucial for making informed decisions in high-stakes environments. This blog explores how using data management with ArcGIS Web Apps can transform intelligence operations. Leveraging advanced tools and methodologies streamlines data access, enhances collaboration, and supports automated analysis\u2014ultimately leading to more informed and timely actions in critical missions. Part 1 of this blog covers data management with ArcGIS System. Be sure to check out Part 2 to learn about Automating Workflows in Real-Time. Simplify data access and sharing Using ArcGIS Experience Builder, we created a configured landing page where analysts tracking regional stability in the Indo-Pacific Theater can easily find the relevant data, tools, and products aligned with their mission. The landing page provides access to a regional data viewer where users can interact with different datasets in a web map. Leveraging ArcGIS as a data management system, users can explore and derive insights from categorized data within their area of interest (AOI). To understand what data our organization has access to, the Add Data widget in Experience Builder connects to collaborative groups in Portal for ArcGIS, where others focused on this AOI have published data relevant to Indo-Pacific missions. Through the widget, users can pull different types of spatial information into the data viewer to build out their understanding of the operating environment, beginning the process of creating actionable intelligence. Construct a survey with Generative AI As we move into more analytical workflows, sometimes we need to request additional data to fill gaps in information. We chose to enable team members to request missing data by creating a survey using Survey123 and its new generative AI capabilities. By inputting specifications for the information we wanted to capture, the AI, using large language models, provided a draft survey in seconds. We asked Survey123 to create a survey that allows respondents to: Describe data they are looking for Define potential sources of that information Identify an area of interest on a map Indicate the urgency of their request After reviewing the initial draft, we prompted the AI Assistant to make some adjustments, such as marking certain questions as \u201crequired.\u201d The finalized, published survey was integrated directly into our web map interface, allowing analysts on the Indo-Pacific monitoring team to submit new requests seamlessly. The submitted requests are sent to our organization\u2019s data steward, who integrates the requested data into our shared content using group sharing capabilities in ArcGIS. Integrate external data sources automatically Once gaps in data have been identified and new information requested to fill them, we can automate the task of pulling data from external souces using ArcGIS Notebooks and ArcGIS API for Python. The open source GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) event data captures events by monitoring news media across a variety of platforms. We queried GDELT\u2019s API and created a feature layer in our portal from the response. GDELT updates this data on a 15-minute interval, so we scheduled a Notebook task to run every 15 minutes, updating the associated feature layer with the most recent GDELT reporting. The feature layer is then shared to a group, making the dynamic, conditioned dataset available at a programmatic level\u2014all automatically. By scheduling tasks to run in Notebooks to capture updates in dynamic data feeds, we save significant analyst time while ensuring timely access to critical information.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 21, 2024 Using hexagons and centroids to model context-specific customer-derived trade areas By Helen Thompson In previous articles, I discussed the methods used to create customer-derived trade areas (CDTAs), explored several advanced options and use cases, while also discussing how to use density-based cluster analysis to refine the customer set used in creating trade areas. In this article, I will continue to expand on more advanced and innovative uses of CDTAs in topics such as site prospecting, customer behavior analysis, and estimating market potential or loss. To do this, I will combine ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro\u2019s Generate Grids and Hexagons tool, using centroid creation and GeoEnrichment to generate a new set of points that act as a probability surface. You can use this surface as a model of opportunity or need, allowing it to act as a set of optimized \u201carchetype\u201d customers against which to evaluate customer interactions, opportunities, and engagements. Substituting demographic-based centroids for customer points Customer-derived trade areas are enclosures around a set of points, usually representing customers, that are delineated by a set tolerance (such as a proportion of the points) or a specific weight (such as sales or another condition of interest). Although they\u2019re called \u201ccustomer-derived trade areas,\u201d the same workflow could be used to analyze data not tied to \u201ccustomers\u201d: how 911 calls are distributed around first responder sites, how school districts match resources to their pupil enrollment, or how insurance claims may best be prioritized based on aid centers. There are applications for CDTAs in environmental and ecological analysis, healthcare, government, utilities, and every industry that uses spatial analysis. Throughout the following sections, I am going to replace customer points with a set of regular Uber H3 hexagon centroids. Why would an ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro user need to do that? One scenario, which is common in retail analysis, is to model the potential for a new store. You don\u2019t have existing customers for a new store, but you do have ideas of the market potential. So in this analysis, I am going to use hexagons that are a quarter of a mile in area and enrich them with a custom market potential calculation. For a pediatric hospital or pharmacy, that potential could be modeled using age breakdowns and population statistics, while for a transit agency it might be commute characteristics. The points represent an archetypal surface of potential, demand, or need mentioned in my introduction. I used the Generate Grids and Hexagons geoprocessing tool in Business Analyst Pro to generate them, enriching each centroid with the specific attributes I want in my model. The result is an estimation of the sales potential for each location based on the characteristics of my existing customer base. In the screenshot below, I have symbolized the land-based centroids, that have been enriched with both population and spending variables. Places with high spending potential are shown in green, transitioning to purple where there is low potential. Areas without centroids are places where either spending or population are zero. The map illustrates potential target markets, with a concentration of green centroids, that closely match the archetypal (desired) customer audience. Most of the audience are in more rural locations to the northeast but in the Bay Area itself, close to the store, San Jose stands out, as well as San Leandro and the communities around Berkeley. My CDTA analysis will use this market opportunity point layer instead of customers. Creating market potential thresholds One area that CDTA excels at is turning market opportunity surfaces into quantitative insights showing how much market could be captured and how well an organization\u2019s locations are performing compared to that potential. In the screenshot below, I have created four trade areas using the detailed method, which represent increasingly large potential markets. Each ring shows ten percent of the available opportunity moving out from the store. I have simplified the symbology of the centroids and colored each opportunity ring from red to blue. The first ten percent of market opportunity that the store could capture, shown in red, is within 21 miles of the store. Ten to twenty percent of the opportunity (yellow) is within the next ten miles, ending at the 31-mile mark. This means that the same market capture opportunity exists within half the geometric distance. The thirtieth and fortieth percentile occur at 38 and 45 miles, respectively. Statistically, this means that half the opportunity is within 31 miles, but the next half is within half the distance to the store, an additional 15 miles. Using the detailed method, the CDTAs appear like concentric rings that are not representative of how customers would travel to the store. The drive times method, shown in the next screenshot, generates a ",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Business Nov 21, 2024 Drive customer growth with target marketing in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro By Elif Bulut and Gemma Goodale-Sussen and Darren Cook Understanding who your core customers are and locating others like them is critical for strategic and sustainable business growth. ArcGIS Business Analyst\u2019s Target Marketing Wizard offers a powerful approach to analyze customer insights and assess market reach, allowing companies to identify high-potential areas and customer segments for maximum return on investment. In this blog post, we\u2019ll guide you through a step-by-step workflow using ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro, demonstrating how to leverage target marketing for a data-driven strategy for reaching your ideal customer segments. Using a solar panel company in California as a case study, you\u2019ll learn how to create customer and market area profiles, identify high-value segments, and map insights to drive growth. Workflow Overview This workflow covers the essential steps for building a target marketing strategy in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro. Following these steps will help you understand your current customer base, identify areas with growth potential, and make informed marketing decisions. Step One: Create a Customer Profile Start by grouping your customers into segments based on shared characteristics like lifestyle, location, and spending habits. This profile will reveal which customer segments are most engaged with your product. Step Two: Define a Market Area and Create a Market Area Profile Define the geographic area you want to analyze, such as a state or city, and create a market profile of this area. Comparing this profile with your customer segments highlights areas where your brand has growth potential. Step Three: Perform a Four Quadrant Analysis Use the Four Quadrant Analysis to categorize your customers into Core, Developmental, Niche, and Monitor segments. Step Four: Map the Target Groups Map customer segments and potential growth areas to see where core and developmental groups are concentrated geographically. Step Five: Reporting Generate detailed reports that summarize customer segmentation, market potential, and media habits, helping refine your marketing decisions. Step-by-Step Target Marketing Analysis Step One: Create a Customer Profile A Customer Profile is an organized summary that categorizes your customer base by key characteristics like location, lifestyle, and spending habits. This profile groups, or \u201csegments,\u201d customers with shared traits, offering valuable insights into what motivates their purchasing behaviors. By understanding these segments, you can tailor your marketing efforts more effectively. Esri\u2019s Tapestry segmentation system provides a structured approach to this process, grouping communities across the United States into manageable segments based on demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics. As the foundation of your target marketing analysis, the Customer Profile helps you see where different customer types are located, guiding your strategy to better connect with each group. Preparing Customer Data for Target Marketing Before using your data in the Target Marketing Wizard, ensure it\u2019s in layer format. To begin, add your customer data to ArcGIS Pro: Under the Map tab, click Add Data, then Browse to locate and select your customer data file (such as an Excel file). Once your data is added, ensure it\u2019s in layer format for use in the Target Marketing Wizard: Right-click the customer file in the Contents pane and select XY Table to Point. In the dialog box, specify a name for your new layer in the Output Feature Class field. Click OK to create a customer point layer, which is now ready for target marketing analysis. Running the Target Marketing Wizard Open the Target Marketing Wizard Go to the Analysis tab in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro.

    "date": "2024-11-20",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 20, 2024 Introducing Europe (Beta) data source in ArcGIS Business Analyst By S David and Gemma Goodale-Sussen The new European Cross-border Data (Beta) data source combines thirty-nine European countries into one group and can be used for mapping and analysis in Business Analyst. This data source is provided by Michael Bauer Research (MBR). Since this is an initial beta release of a European regional data source, the data and boundaries are subject to change in future releases. Europe (Beta) is a data source that provides customers with the ability to create maps, run reports, and perform analyses that span country borders. Currency values are in euros (\u20ac) to facilitate cross-border comparisons. This new aggregated data source provides a broad variety of sociodemographic and consumer data. The sixty-five available indicators include: Data are available on internationally comparable geographical levels and hexagon grids. Data are compiled on administrative, postcode, and micro levels compatible to existing available boundaries. In Business Analyst Web App, hover over the Info button and browse the data source details. Use Europe (Beta) in Business Analyst Web App In Business Analyst Web App, select a data source in the Data source drop-down menu. Set the data source to Europe (Beta). An example of how we can use this cross-border data source is to analyze purchasing power across countries in Europe using a color-coded map. On the Maps tab, click Create maps and click Color-coded maps. In the Geography section, use the current map extent. (The map\u2019s analysis extent automatically updates to show the countries available for the data source.) Use Countries as the level of detail and select the Purchasing Power: Total variable list. Let\u2019s use the Dot density with area color map style and change the color ramp to a pink color scheme with the High to low theme. The darkest color on the map (in this case, burgundy) represents the highest purchasing power value whereas the lightest color (in this case, pale yellow or ecru) represents the lowest purchasing power value. In the Legend section, use the Classify data toggle button to classify the data by numbers in billions of purchasing power. This example uses a color-coded map to visualize purchasing power for the 39 countries included in the Europe (Beta) data source. Cross-border analysis with the Europe (Beta) data source can be utilized with any mapping and analysis capability. Europe (Beta) infographics Let\u2019s run infographics in Business Analyst Web App. There are two infographic templates specifically designed for the Europe (Beta) data source: Population and Spending Summary (Standard) and Europe Summary Report (Tabular). We can use the earlier example of a color-coded map visualizing purchasing power. Click on a few countries to add them as sites to the analysis. We\u2019ll use France and Germany for our infographic comparison. Right-click France and click Infographics on the site\u2019s pop-up menu. The infographic viewer appears. In the infographic drop-down menu, choose the new infographic Population and Spending Summary (Standard) from the drop-down menu and click Run infographic. Let\u2019s add Germany to our analysis. Click the site detail and click + Add sites to compare. In the Select Site window, click the Currently on map tab and select another site then click Apply. Click the site drop-down menu and turn the Side by side comparison toggle button on. Now we can compare the Population and Spending Summary (Standard) infographic between France and Germany. In the infographic builder, we can view a different infographic. Click the infographic name to expand the infographics drop-down list, expand Standard infographics, and click Europe Summary Report (Tabular). This tabular infographic template displays data tables with a comprehensive overview of population totals disaggregated by gender, household totals, purchasing power, expenditures by category, and area of the site.

    "date": "2024-11-19",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 19, 2024 Considerations for working with benchmark comparisons in Business Analyst Pro vs. Business Analyst Web App By S David and Gemma Goodale-Sussen ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App and the ArcGIS Business Analyst extension in ArcGIS Pro have long been companion applications for spatial analysis. Business Analyst Web App is a go-to product for web-based GIS for users who want to understand communities, support business expansion, and identify market opportunities. It is updated three times a year, in line with ArcGIS Online product releases. Business Analyst Pro, on the other hand, is part of Esri\u2019s powerhouse ArcGIS Pro desktop software and is released for download twice a year. It extends the web capabilities with more advanced workflows, territory design, customer analysis, and more. Because Business Analyst products are developed in tandem, workflows in one application often serve as inspiration for the other application. This is the case with benchmark comparisons, which was completely redesigned for Business Analyst Web App\u2019s November 2024 release, including new mapping capabilities. The workflow was also introduced in Business Analyst Pro 3.4, released in November 2024 as well. In Business Analyst Web App, the benchmark comparisons workflow compares sites using criteria and benchmark values that you set. Results are displayed on a map and in the Results pane. On the map, the styling can be changed using different comparison methods. The Results pane includes a summary, histogram, bubble chart, and table. In the table, you can compare with geographies to expand the analysis. On the Summary tab, you can use in-app documentation to learn about the underlying statistics. In Business Analyst Pro, the benchmark comparisons workflow compares locations using variables and site attributes. Results are displayed on the map and in the Results pane. Significantly, benchmark comparisons are the final capability from the previous ArcGIS Desktop software to be incorporated into ArcGIS Pro\u2014bringing Business Analyst into full equivalency with the well-loved (but retired) software product. This article walks through the basic similarities and differences between these two sister workflows in Business Analyst. What is the same between the two workflows? There are many similarities between the two workflows. Fundamentally, both workflows compare sites using variables, set a benchmark, and visualize it on the map and in the Results pane. Choosing a variable Geographic data is the lifeblood of Business Analyst. The benchmark comparisons workflow allows you to explore the data to your heart\u2019s content by choosing as many variables as you want. In Business Analyst Web App, you can compare up to 10,000 sites. The experience of selecting variables is nearly identical between Business Analyst Web App and Business Analyst Pro. Both applications use the data browser (Web App / Pro) for adding variables to the comparison, the only difference being how you get there. In Business Analyst Web App, click Browse all variables to access the data browser. In Business Analyst Pro, you can add variables from the data browser (by clicking the Add button) as well as site attributes from the input features you added. Site attributes could be things like the area of the polygon (as in the example below, with Kentucky ZIP codes) or your own data such as sales volume for a trade area. Setting a benchmark As the name implies, one of the central functionalities of the benchmark comparisons workflow is setting a benchmark against which to compare the data across sites or features. In both Business Analyst Web App and Business Analyst Pro, you can identify the benchmark as a value\u2014such as the median or average of all sites\u2014or as the values for a specific site or feature. In Business Analyst Web App, you can set the benchmark in two different ways: In the Comparison method section, use the Method drop-down menu and click Above and below benchmark. Use the Benchmark drop-down menu to select a site to set as the benchmark. In the Table on the Results pane, click the Options button for a location and click Make benchmark. The Above and below benchmark comparison method is automatically implemented. If you add average or median in the Statistics section, it can be used as the benchmark. You can use either percentage or raw values for the difference type. In Business Analyst Pro, you can set a benchmark within the workflow pane by clicking the Benchmark tab and specifying the parameters. These parameters include the type of benchmark, the ways of showing the difference between each feature\u2019s value and the benchmark value, and the symbology for showing the difference in the Results pane. Note that the benchmark parameters can be adjusted continuously as you work, and updated by clicking Apply. In the Results pane, the benchmark is placed as the first row or column of the table. You can also alter the benchmark using the Benchmar",

    "date": "2024-11-18",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 18, 2024 Combining clustering and advanced analytics with customer-derived trade areas in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro By Helen Thompson In a previous article, I introduced advanced customer-derived trade areas in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro. This article combines those techniques and methods with other analytical capabilities specifically using HDBSCAN for clustering and filtering customers, and using hexbin geographics and centroids to create modeled trade areas for proposed locations and estimate market opportunity. I\u2019ll build on and show you how to apply the different Method parameters in the areas and use analysis to better define core customer groups and reduce the impact of dispersed customers in trade area creation. I\u2019ll also introduce weights and cut-offs to show how customer attributes and behaviors can be modeled and used in understanding location performance and fit with community demographics. The impact of dispersed and isolated customers Customer-derived trade areas depict an enclosed shape around a proportion of customers based on either their distribution or an attribute weight such as sales or another condition of interest. As a result, the shape can be strongly influenced by geographically isolated features, which create spikes, or locations with a high score for an attribute that can contribute disproportionally to the trade area volume. In the example above, there are customer locations in the Pacific Ocean and in water features. These are outlined in blue and are likely the result of poor geocoding or other errors at the time of capture. Isolated or dispersed points, highlighted in red, are also evident and may lead to spikes or the enclosed trade area \u201cgrowing\u201d towards these points rather than including the clusters nearby. As you look at the map above, you will see other examples I have not highlighted. When you review the customer-derived trade area below, which uses the simple method, you can see how potentially erroneous and dispersed points have impacted the shape. For some organizations, capturing the cluster is the most important driver. While we can be selective and easily filter out outlying customers based on their attributes, analytical techniques can help us constrain and enforce different rules that will influence how the trade area is constructed. For the example above, we might want to include more points around San Jose in the south and fewer to the north and east, to better reflect the distribution and density of the customer points. Modifying candidate customer locations with cluster analysis ArcGIS Pro has some powerful density-based clustering tools in the Spatial Statistics extension, including Density-based Clustering. These tools find clusters of point features within surrounding noise based on their spatial distribution. Of the three clustering method options, I tend to use the Self-adjusting (HDBSCAN) option because it finds clusters of points with varying densities based on cluster probability or stability. It uses varying distances that are based on point distributions, rather than a predetermined distance that DBSCAN requires. This makes HDBSCAN more appropriate for clusters like those shown in the San Franciso examples in the article, when clusters may occur in outlying communities as well in dense urban areas. The Defined distance (DBSCAN) option finds clusters of points that are in close proximity based on a specified search distance and may be a better technique for analysis within urban areas. What I also like about these clustering tools is that they calculate the probability that the point belongs in an assigned cluster (group) and provides an outlier code marking that the point may be an outlier within its own cluster. There are scenarios where this is very useful (but it\u2019s outside of the focus of this article). In the two screenshots below, I have run HDBSCAN on the original set of customer locations and have created a set of clusters which are represented in different colors in the first screenshot. These now form my customer locations for my secondary analysis. You will note that HDBSCAN performs very well but I also have a small number of isolated points near Vacaville and north of Petaluma. I could further filter these outliers or edit out the remaining locations in the water. However, because I am concentrating my analysis on the San Francisco Bay area, the initial output of HDBSCAN is of sufficient quality to use in the next steps of my analysis. Running customer-derived trade areas on the clustered customer set In this section, I will compare the results of using the new clustered customer point set (highlighted in each screenshot) against the original set of locations featured in the previous article. In each example we use the same parameters \u2013 65% of customers \u2013 to create an enclosing hull.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 15, 2024 Celebrating Veterans Day using custom infographics By Caitlin Marin and Christopher Alvarez Veterans Day pays tribute to all American veterans, living or dead, who served in war or peacetime. Using data from The Department of Veterans Affairs Open Data Portal, we created a custom infographic to illustrate veteran information by state. This information can be used to assess the demographics of veterans and better tailor health care resources in the State. Custom data (meaning data from outside of Business Analyst) can be displayed in infographics in ArcGIS Business Analyst and used to visualize key indicators and information for sites. Using data available through the Department of Veterans Affairs Open Data Portal, we can show various data points related to veterans at the state level. Once we decide which data to incorporate, we can select several ways to visualize and interpret that data through the chart options available in the infographic builder. Military service is classified by either wartime or peacetime. The waffle chart on the left column of the infographic divides the veterans by state between these wartime or peacetime designations. Wartime veterans were active-duty during periods of wartime designated by congress, and peacetime veterans were active-duty anytime between those designated wartime periods. To further explore the waffle chart data, the bar chart directly below it then breaks down those who served during a wartime period by the congressionally designated wartimes: World War II, Korean Conflict, Vietnam Era, and/or the Gulf War. For the State of Virginia, for example, most veterans were on active duty during the Gulf War. This information is important to know because veterans who served during wartime periods may face challenges related to that service. Knowing this information can help tailor health services offered to veterans, as they may have faced different environmental exposures, political and cultural experiences, and/or emotional distress. The center of the infographic provides general veterans statistics, such as the total veteran population, female veteran population, male veteran population, and the percentage of the state population that are veterans. It\u2019s important to understand female veteran population, as they have additional health access needs, such as gynecology providers and obstetricians. Lastly, we have a map with points of interest showing resource locations available to veterans. These include general veteran and military services and Veterans Health Administration locations within the state. For this panel, data points were used from both the Department of Veterans Affairs Open Data Portal and POIs found in Business Analyst\u2019s points of interest data. You can hover over the Veterans and Military Information Services or the Veterans Health Administration Facilities panel to explore more information about those points of interest, including the name of the facility. For the Veterans Health Administration Facilities points, additional information regarding the address and phone numbers is given as well. This is a good resource for veterans who may not know of resources around, and available, to them, but also for the community to know where they can show support for veterans. Who can use this infographic? This infographic is widely applicable to many. The first group of users we had in mind when making this infographic was veterans themselves. It\u2019s a way to show appreciation towards their service and acknowledge them. In addition, it provides resource locations for them to seek care if they need it and could highlight options, they may not have known they had. This infographic can also be used by State Veterans Affairs organizations to understand and visualize veteran populations by state and available resources, and to highlight veterans in an easy-to-comprehend way for the public. The data being represented in this format also provides a quick context that can inform decision-making for resources and services provided for veterans in each state. Custom data setup and custom infographics are available with an ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App Advanced license. To learn more about Business Analyst license types, see Licenses. Using custom data to build infographics While this infographic uses custom data to focus on Veterans Day, custom data can be used in infographics for any topic of interest within any industry. Adding custom data to ArcGIS Business Analyst is simple and allows you to use your own organizational data the same way you use Esri Demographics data. It can be used in mapping, analytics, infographics, and reporting workflows. Let\u2019s walk through how we did it for this infographic. We took the data from the Veterans Affairs Open Data Portal and put it into an Excel spreadsheet organized by state name.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 15, 2024 Understanding advanced customer-derived trade areas in ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro By Helen Thompson ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro has a lot of capabilities and using the more advanced options often requires a nuanced understanding of the geoprocessing tool, its methodology and results, coupled with awareness of how the input data influences the results. Even experienced users can be intimidated by choice and sometimes the documentation does not do the software justice. This article provides more detailed insights into how your choice for the Method parameter in the Generate Customer Derived Trade Areas tool will influence the trade area\u2019s shape, size, and degree of conformity to the underlying customer point layer. The basics A customer-derived trade area (CDTA) is an enclosed shape, technically a convex hull, around a proportion of customers based on either their distribution or an attribute weight such as sales, number of visits, or other condition of interest. For example, retailers use CDTAs to identify a \u201ctrue trade area\u201d based on customers from their Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) or detected store visits based on human movement data. Healthcare organizations can identify CDTAs to look at patients who might need specialized care, based on demand for pediatric or geriatric medicine. Warehousing operations use CDTAs to identify market areas based on demand for goods or services, using spending or potential. Business Analyst Pro\u2019s Generate Customer Derived Trade Areas tool can base its calculations on both actual customers or predictive populations using centroids or other point-based datasets. The methods When using the tool, there are six methods that each create a specific type of customer-derived trade area. While each method can use raw counts of customers or a weight based on customer attributes, each generates a unique form of trade area. These vary from a simple multi-sided, irregular polygon with around a dozen points to a simplified cubic spline. Other methods generate a smooth, organic amoeba while the most complex, a drive time, can contain thousands of individual vertex points. Simple A generalized trade area using the outermost points connected via straight lines generated as a minimal convex hull with no indentations. In the following screenshots, I will include the simple method outline to compare the differences in the methods. Amoeba A trade area fit to an expanded set of maximal points connected using natural curvature. This can include indentations and extensions. Detailed A detailed set of boundaries, typically 2-5 times the number of points used in the simple trade area, using straight lines which can include indentations and may create triangular spikes. Detailed with smoothing This is the default method, which fits a cubic spline version of the detailed trade area using smoothed curves. A small subset of points from the detailed trade area is connected using low-degree polynomials. This method considers the shape and pattern of the customer distribution, which may result in the highest level of simplification but the most pleasing smoothed shape. Threshold Rings Creates concentric rings that expand out from the chosen store(s) until each ring contains the specified threshold of customers. This is the minimum-sized circle that will include the desired number of customers. Threshold Drive Times The most complex and computationally expensive option, that expands out from stores along network routes until each trade area contains the specified threshold of customers. Drive times can use distance- or time-based parameters and supports a range of methods from walking to trucking. The nuances I often get asked \u201cWhich method is best?\u201d and \u201cWhy is detailed with smoothing the default? Like so much in GIS, the answer to which method is best is: it depends. The detailed with smoothing method is the default because it generates a very simple enclosure that is like a modified ring, which has historically been how many organizations begin the process of understanding true trade areas. Where the ring deforms, and how it deforms, highlights the distribution of customers in a similar way to how you would physically draw them using pen and paper. The other methods emphasize different distribution characteristics. Threshold rings allow the user to summarize the maximum distance(s) customers are from the destination. It provides a way to understand desirability and/or accessibility. For example, the travel distance may be quite different for the same percentage of customers based on whether the location and customers are in urban, suburban, or rural settings. In the example below, I created rings for the top ten percent of customers for each store. You can see how the customer-derived trade areas vary in size, so much so that the area of the largest is almost fifty time bigger than the smallest. Simple and threshold rings work as a good standard to desc",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Transportation Nov 14, 2024 Announcing the new Business Analyst transit infographic By Stacy Schaetzl Transit systems play a critical role in connecting communities, addressing congestion, driving economic development, and improving mobility and equity. Following up on the Esri Transit initiative launched in summer 2024, we are pleased to announce the release of the first-ever transit infographic available in Esri\u2019s Business Analyst Web App. The information provided on the new Transit Stop Analysis infographic was specifically chosen to help transit agencies understand the populations and destinations they are serving at their stops, including: Vulnerable populations, such as the number of elderly, disabled, or persons without vehicle access. Languages spoken in the vicinity, so timetable and route information can be provided in alternate languages where needed. Population income levels, with specific focus on the population living below 150% of the poverty threshold. Locations in proximity to transit stops such as apartment buildings, businesses, and medical facilities. The number and type of other nearby transit stops within an area. Much of this information is also critical in supporting compliance with Federal Title VI requirements; this was a key consideration in the design of the infographic. Transit and Infographics in Business Analyst (BA) Some of you may be saying, \u201cWell, this all sounds very interesting, but I\u2019m not familiar with Business Analyst or infographics.\u201d That\u2019s totally ok. The great thing about infographics is that they are very easy to use, and this article will give you step-by-step guidance through examples a little later. To provide some background for new users, Business Analyst (BA) is an Esri software product that includes ready-to-use, authoritative demographic, business, lifestyle, and spending data paired with powerful geospatial and analytic tools. Inside BA, one of the ways this data can be displayed \u2013 besides on a map \u2013 is through infographics. Infographics are presentation-ready, visual reports that summarize key data trends. For further reading on infographics, the blog Learn about infographics in ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App offers a great introduction to the topic. There are many pre-configured infographic templates available in BA, for topics ranging from Economic Development to Community Outreach. With the November 2024 release, this now includes the new Transit Stop Analysis infographic. This infographic can be found in the BA Web App infographics gallery. By default, this infographic leverages data available in BA with the new Esri Transit Stop feature service , which is available through the Living Atlas. Alternatively, a user can swap out the Esri Transit Stop feature service to their own ArcGIS Online layer; this is discussed later in this article. Note there is also a \u201c\u2018sibling\u201d template to this new transit infographic in the gallery called Title VI Navigator. This template contains most of the same information as the Transit Stop Analysis infographic, but without the transit-specific components. How to use the Transit Stop Analysis infographic The steps for running the new infographic in Business Analyst follow this general pattern: Create an area you want to analyze \u2013 for instance, a walk time or a buffer around a transit stop. Alternatively, select a standard geography like the census block group or ZIP code that your stop falls in. Run the infographic for your area. Behind the scenes, the calculations are performed and all the panels on the infographic will update. Even irregularly shaped areas like walk-time areas are no problem. Analyze your results and share with others. You can export infographics as a PDF, an html item, or even an Excel file. Let\u2019s walk through this process with an example. You will need your Business Analyst Web App license to follow along. Example workflow Say you are a transit organization considering a new transit stop location in Nashville, TN. Will this new stop provide service to businesses in the area so people can reach jobs? Will it need signage printed in languages other than English? To get started, log in to Business Analyst Web App. From the Home page, click New project and open the map interface. Click on the Pin tool on the right-hand side of the interface, and then click in the map where you\u2019d like to add a new transit stop. Give it a name. In the image below, we have created a stop location called \u201cProposed New Stop.\u201d Click the option to Create site. For this example, we will create a site that is a walk time of 5 minutes. Note you can provide up to three walk times, drive times, or distance rings to run at once. Click Apply to generate your walkshed.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 14, 2024 Use new POI search capabilities to map parking and entertainment in ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App By Yann Bovet and S David As part of the November 2024 release, ArcGIS Business Analyst Web App has an updated and redesigned points of interest (POI) search workflow. The POI search workflow finds places and plots them on a map. Enhancements to this workflow include the following: The search options have been redesigned to improve discoverability. Searches can be prefiltered using an advanced search with conditions. The new Place map style provides default sets of POI icons for datasets, enabling one-click intuitive symbology. The search results are now populated in the new Results pane, featuring a summary, histogram, bubble chart or scatterplot, and downloadable table. In this blog article, we\u2019ll use a POI search to analyze parking and entertainment in Lausanne, Switzerland. We need to identify where places for entertainment are located and whether there is ample public parking nearby. Set the data source First, let\u2019s use the Data source drop-down menu to set Switzerland as the data source. Points of interest data (also known as Places data) is available regionally from different providers. For more information, see Introduction to Places data. For Switzerland, the places data is provided by Foursquare. Set the analysis extent Now that the data source is set to Switzerland, let\u2019s start the POI search workflow. On the Maps tab, click Create maps and select Points of interest (POI) search. For Analysis extent, enter Vaud and select the Canton Vaud result. Map an advanced search We can start entering our search criteria in the Search section of the workflow pane. Click the Enter keyword, category, etc. field and click the Advanced search tab. We are interested in searching for all places for entertainment and parking in the area. Click + Add condition. To add a condition, you must select a field, then choose a filter operator and set a value. Create a condition as follows: For the field, select Category. For the filter operator, choose is any of the following. For the value, select Arts and Entertainment (All). In the Enter category name field, type parking and select Parking. We can also use an advanced search condition to make our search more complex and our results more specific. Since there is a restriction on returning a maximum of 5,000 points, using an advanced search condition is useful to make the query as specific as possible for the most relevant searching. Let\u2019s refine the results to focus on a single city and prefilter the results to the city of Lausanne. Create a condition as follows: For the field, select Locality. For the filter operator, choose is. For the value, enter Lausanne. Click Search to perform the points of interest search with the new advanced condition. The places are added to the map. Zoom in to explore the results. Filter the results We can also use a filter to further refine our results. While prefiltering uses conditions to create a more specific search, filtering refines the search results to return more specific places. Click Show filters and expand the Postcode drop-down menu. Let\u2019s check the postcode 1003, 1004, and 1005 options. The filter is automatically applied, and the map results are updated. Stylize the map By default, the map uses the Location (single symbol) style. Click the Style drop-down menu and select Place. The point icons are replaced with curated icons that match the datasets. This new map style provides one-click symbology. This provides quick visual identification for the types of places represented by the points. Let\u2019s increase the icon sizes. Click Show style options and drag the Size slider to increase the icons to size 35. Optionally, use the Cluster points toggle button to aggregate points into clusters or display them individually on the map. In the Legend section, find and click the icon for parking. In the symbolization menu, use the Size slider to increase the parking icon size to 50. Now all of the parking icons are the largest icons on the map. Use the map legend to reference what the icons symbolize and how many places are identified on the map. Explore the results Let\u2019s explore the Results pane. The Results pane in our scenario features a summary, histogram, and attribute table. On the Summary tab, use the horizontal scroll bar to see the Top 5 primary industries. Click the Table tab to view the results as a table. Hover over an item in the table to highlight the corresponding site on the map. Optionally, click Customize table to modify the columns in the table. Drag the name of a column to change its order in the table. Uncheck the check box next to the column name to deselect it from the table. Points of interest can be used alone or in tandem with additional data to enrich the analysis. For instance, run infographics for your sites. Use the Transit Stop Analysis infographic to see walk time distances. This ",

Before you all get ready for the holidays and enjoy your planned vacations, we wanted to provide you with the last release of the year for ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro! ArcGIS Business Analyst Pro is an extension for ArcGIS Pro that allows you to perform sophisticated spatial analysis and modeling, including customer and competitor analysis, territory design, target marketing, and site selection. I first want to say, what a year for the Business Analyst team. We have been bringing you innovative enhancements and updates with every single release \u2013 and we\u2019re not stopping there! We will continue to focus on this and provide you with new capabilities in the future. So let\u2019s get right into the updates. With the ArcGIS Pro November 2024 release, check out the following updates to Business Analyst Pro: Updates to suitability analysis workflow New benchmark comparisons workflow Updates to color-coded layers Updates to territory design Updates to the data browser Access to new Europe (Beta) data source Updates to suitability analysis workflow Suitability analysis is an extremely powerful tool that helps you rank and score locations based on multiple weighted criteria\u2014and now we have made it even better. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for your next business location and you want to use your current best-performing location as a reference. Easily use the new \u201cTarget Site\u201d functionality to rank potential sites in comparison to your ideal site. You can view the results in an interactive summary view that clearly shows where the target value falls among the other value distributions. We\u2019ve also made additional improvements to the workflow interface by providing you with more control over how your sites are scored by adding detailed scoring methods, new weighting options, and symbology controls. New benchmark comparisons workflow With this release, we are adding a new benchmark comparisons workflow. This new workflow facilitates feature comparisons using variables and site attributes. You can create a benchmark, add nearby geographies to the comparison, and even export the comparison table to Excel. We\u2019ve also added an interactive Results pane that compares sites to the benchmark by above and below icons. Simply hover over an icon to view the difference between the location and the set benchmark. Updates to color-coded layers The color-coded layer workflow is a popular tool that creates a group layer that visualizes the distribution of a selected variable on the map. We are excited to announce that the color-coded layer workflow now connects to all countries that are supported through ArcGIS GeoEnrichment via online data, as well as all local datasets. Wait, there\u2019s more\u2014we know how much you all love using hexagons as part of your analysis. Now we have added hexagons as a mapping option in color-coded layers. Simply toggle between geographies and hexagons in all local datasets, as well as the United States and Europe cross-border data. We\u2019ve also added a new Results Pane that helps you gain more visibility, analysis, and understanding of what\u2019s on the map. You can view the results through interactive data summaries, visualizations, and a table. Updates to territory design Territory design is a set of tools to build, edit, balance, and maintain territories for point and polygon datasets. We have made significant improvements to territory design and are excited to share them with you. One of the enhancements we made is to the Modify Territories pane. Previously, you were able to set size constraints for your territories but if features were swapped around, there was really no notification to tell you that the constraint had been broken. Now, in the Modify Territories pane we added a warning icon and pop-up when territory constraints are broken, as well as a pop-up menu with statistics that will appear if the territory is breaking or in danger of breaking an attribute constraint. Another great feature we have added is a new Select Territory command. With this command, you can easily drag and drop assignments on the map and reassign them to another territory. Another enhancement we made is adding the Filter by Adjacent Features command to the Modify Territories pane, which improves the experience of manual editing and refining your analysis. With this feature enabled, say good-bye to trying to guess which territories are adjacent to the selected features from the list. When enabled, only territory features adjacent to the selected features are displayed in the pane and map. Moreover, we have made additional improvements to the manual territory editing process and territory reassignment, as well as added additional charts and statistics to help users to understand their territories better.

With the November 2024 release of ArcGIS Dashboards, we can now add date axis guides to a serial chart in a dashboard. The new date axis guides feature allows you to highlight important dates or range of dates directly on your charts, adding extra context that helps viewers interpret the data quickly and effectively. In previous releases, we introduced features like splash screens and info windows to help dashboard authors provide additional context without cluttering the interface. A key area of focus this release has been improving the visualization of important dates on a timeline. With the new date axis guides, authors can now highlight a specific date or range of dates directly on the serial chart, making it easier for viewers to understand the context of the data and the impact of events at a glance. These guides provide clear, visual markers that help pinpoint key dates without overwhelming the dashboard or taking up valuable screen real estate. Configure date axis guides Let\u2019s explore how to set up date axis guides within a dashboard, using a real-world scenario. This example dashboard focuses on the Mpox outbreak in Europe over the past two years. Mpox (formerly known as Monkeypox) is a viral disease transmitted through close contact with infected animals or humans. This dashboard tracks the progression of the outbreak across Europe, visualizing key data such as total confirmed cases, deaths, new confirmed cases, and cumulative cases over time. We want to add context about key dates related to the outbreak, such as when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Instead of relying on sidebars or chart descriptions to communicate key dates, we can use date axis guides to display them directly on the charts. To do this, the first step is to ensure that the Parse Dates toggle is enabled in the serial chart settings. This ensures the chart correctly recognizes and displays date-based data, allowing us to add date axis guides. Range date axis guide We can now configure a range date axis guide from July 23, 2022, when the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency, to May 12, 2023, when this status was reassessed. We can also add a label (e.g., \u201cWHO PHEIC\u201d) for clarity and hover text to give viewers more context on the significance of that period in the dataset. The chart immediately updates to highlight the selected date range, with the hover text providing additional details. Single date axis guide Another key date to highlight on the chart is November 17, 2022, when an additional 2 million doses of the Mpox vaccine were secured. We can add a single date axis guide with the label \u201cVaccine Allocation\u201d, hover text and add a different color (e.g., purple) for easy distinction. When labels overlap, we can easily adjust the positioning to ensure clarity\u2014moving labels to the bottom or changing their color to make them easier to read. The chart instantly updates to show the single date axis guide along with the hover text. Maximizing space and improving clarity By adding these date axis guides, we\u2019ve effectively reclaimed space on the dashboard that would otherwise be occupied by long text descriptions. The result is a much cleaner, more streamlined dashboard that provides the same level of information\u2014only now, it\u2019s easier for viewers to digest. Authors can provide hover text over the date axis guide to offer additional context, eliminating the need to sift through walls of text and ensuring a more effortless and engaging experience. Summary Date axis guides are a simple yet powerful way to add valuable context to your serial charts. Whether you\u2019re tracking trends over time or highlighting key events, these guides allow you to draw attention to important moments on the timeline\u2014making your charts clearer and more informative. We look forward to seeing how you\u2019ll use this feature to bring your own data to life. Share this article Soobin Choi Soobin is a product engineer on the ArcGIS Dashboards team.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 22, 2024 Improving Data Quality for Water Utilities Webinar Q&A By Mary Mozingo and Mike Miller and Jay Cary On November 13, 2024, we held a webinar on Improving Data Quality for Water Utilities. In today\u2019s rapidly evolving utility landscape, ensuring high-quality data for efficient operations, compliance, and customer satisfaction is essential for water utilities. In this webinar we covered the critical role of data quality management in optimizing water utility performance. We explore best practices for ensuring accurate, reliable data and migrating to ArcGIS Utility Network\u2014the next-generation spatial information system that enhances network modeling, data analysis, and decision-making. You can now watch the webinar recording and explore our Q&A from the live session in this blog. If you cannot find the answers you were looking for, please post your questions on the ArcGIS Data Reviewer community place. Technical questions What types of geodatabases are supported with Data Reviewer-based attribute rules? Data Reviewer\u2019s automated checks are supported in both validation and constraint attribute rules. In ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4, validation and batch calculation attribute rules are supported in file, mobile, and branch-versioned enterprise geodatabases. Constraint and immediate calculation attribute rules are supported in file, mobile and enterprise geodatabases (branch, traditional, and non-versioned). How are the attribute rule error layers created? Attribute rule error layers are a series of system-maintained datasets that store error features created during evaluation of either a batch calculation or validation attribute rule. These datasets are automatically created when the first batch calculation or validation rule is created in a geodatabase. See the evaluate attribute rules documentation for more information. Does data reviewer have to be in a utility network model in order to use data reviewer in Pro? No, the data reviewer rules can be configured for any geodatabase based feature class or table. If you want to define attribute rules on data in the Asset Package, you will need to enable Global IDs as the GlobalID field is set as a GUID type. Is Utility Network only available through ArcGIS Enterprise? The Utility Network is available in File and Mobile Geodatabases, as well as ArcGIS Enterprise. Could you provide a link to the new data dictionary mentioned in the slides? All of the data dictionaries are now included with the solution when it is deployed. We are working on adding a link to our help site. Is it possible to export Reviewer-based attribute rules to see the Arcade expression? Validation attribute rules implemented using Data Reviewer checks do not rely on Arcade to perform data validation. Instead, checks leverage a validation engine that is purpose-built to efficiently query and analyze spatial data. This engine provides improved performance by optimizing queries on your geodatabase, combining multiple rules during validation and generating error results that more precisely depict error conditions. Would a utility network prevent or not permit these types of issues? The utility network error model does capture some errors we configured Data Reviewer to discover, but does not provide all the validation of attributes, such as ensuring all valves have a valid status. Are all Data Reviewer checks that were available in ArcMap available in attribute rule workflows? Integration of Data Reviewer\u2019s automated checks in attribute rule-based workflows began with the ArcGIS Pro 2.5 and ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8 releases. With each successive release, additional checks were implemented and, in some cases, enhanced to better support attribute rule workflows. Except for the Valency check, all checks planned for migration are now available. See the ArcGIS Data Reviewer product roadmap for additional information on what\u2019s planned in the future. What are the plans for support of Data Reviewer\u2019s ArcMap-based quality control capabilities in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Enterprise? Several of Data Reviewer\u2019s most used ArcMap workflows are available in ArcGIS Pro to support those organizations who have a mixed environment of ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro deployments. These workflows include the use of existing Reviewer Batch Jobs to automate data validation, visual review tools, and the storage of error results in a Reviewer workspace. With the upcoming retirement of ArcMap, customers are strongly encouraged to migrate their QC workflows to attribute rules as soon as possible. See the Migration from ArcMap to ArcGIS Pro for data validation topic for more information. How can we clean our source data without Data Reviewer? Can the errors be identified and addressed manually as a one-time cleanup prior to migration? You can use Arcade expressions in Attribute rules to validate your data. Also, you can use the available core ArcGIS Pro geoprocessing tools to identify data issue",
    "summary": "This blog post covers a Q&A from a webinar on improving data quality for water utilities using ArcGIS Data Reviewer. Key topics include:\n- Data Reviewer's support for attribute rules in various geodatabase types \n- How attribute rule error layers are created\n- Differences between Data Reviewer and topology rules for data validation\n- Licensing requirements for Data Reviewer in ArcGIS Pro and Enterprise\n- Migrating from Esri's Local Government Information Model to the Utility Network\nWhile Data Reviewer is not required to resolve data issues when migrating to the Utility Network, it provides efficient tools to identify many types of errors beyond what the Utility Network detects.",

By Melissa Mayo and Remi Myers Listen Here I recently met David Hansen, the CEO of GEO Jobe, while coordinating for this podcast episode. I didn\u2019t know much about him or the company at the time, but I knew they had a long-standing influence in the GIS field that I suspected would translate into an interesting conversation. I was excited that he was willing to be a guest and after speaking with David for a few times I am thrilled to be able to put a spotlight on him, his leadership practices, and the company as a whole. I learned so much during my conversations with David and I truly hope that his messaging resonates to our listeners. He is inspirational and sets a standard for how a good company culture can and should be established. David has overcome many challenges during his life, however those experiences have left him with an insatiable desire to give back to others. He especially loves providing opportunities to support and develop people from his local coastal communities of Gulfport and Biloxi as well as the remainder of the state of Mississippi. David is proud to have been born and raised in Mississippi and he was so excited to discuss the cultural aspects of the region. David truly taps into the geospatial richness of his area by bringing out the best in others. GEO Jobe is a Platinum Esri Partner and has been an instrumental player in the GIS community since being founded in 1999. They have a global footprint with clients in business sectors ranging from Fortune 500 companies to local governments, utilities, and municipalities.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 07, 2024 Working with Versioned Data in Map Viewer By Maxwell DeBella We are excited to introduce viewing versioned data in the Map Viewer! In this post, we will go over how to configure versioned data on a feature service and how to access the new Version Management tool in Map Viewer. Branched Versioned Data First, let\u2019s start with some background on versioned data. Versions work by acting as snapshots of a single feature service. They allow you and members of your organization to maintain and edit an isolated version of the feature service\u2019s data. Any modifications made on a branched version can be merged back into the default version. This ensures that valuable feature services can be simultaneously accessed and modified without harming the original service. Versions are stored on the parent feature service in a VersionManagementService. This service behaves like a library for all the authored versions. The new Version Management tool checks out a version from the VersionManagementService and renders it on the map. Keep in mind that versions do not persist in the web map. This means that saving or refreshing a web map results in the version being switched back to the default. Closing the tool will not reset the version to default. Authoring Versions in ArcGIS Pro To enable versioning, connect to your enterprise geodatabase. Use the Register As Versioned geoprocessing tool to configure said dataset as versioned. After it has been registered, access branch versioning by right clicking the enterprise geodatabase in the catalog pane. From the Properties dialog, select Manage, check Versioning and finally branch. You can then add versions using the Create Version geoprocessing tool and/or new version on the Versioning tab. Note that if you already published your data with a VersionManagementService, you do not need to republish it to add new versions. How to use the Version Management tool When you publish a versioned dataset to the web, add it to a web map. In addition to a dataset with branch versioned data, you must have an ArcGIS Advanced Editing user type extension to use the Version Management tool. With both conditions met, the Version Management tool will automatically display on the right toolbar. Click the tool, then type or scroll through the list of versions. Select the version you would like to display. Once your version is displayed on the map, feel free to click on any other tools. After you have completed your modifications on your versioned data, you can push it to the default version. Finalizing Branched Changes to the Default Version After you have completed modifying your branch version, you can merge the changes into the default version from the Versioning tab in ArcGIS Pro. Click Post to submit your changes from the branch version into the default version. If the default version has been updated after the creation of your branched version, it will be out of date. To post your changes, you need to reconcile your branch version with the current state of the default version. To do this, click reconcile on the Versioning tab; you will be prompted to define conflicts by attributes or objects. Select the option most relevant to you. Once the differences between versions have been reconciled, you may post your changes to the default version. This concludes the guide on working with versioned data in Map Viewer.

    "date": "2024-11-05",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Administration Nov 05, 2024 ArcGIS Online is FedRAMP Moderate - what this means for ArcGIS Enterprise By Jill Edstrom-Shoemaker You may have heard the news, ArcGIS Online is now FedRAMP Moderate authorized. This is an exciting announcement for many ArcGIS users! This authorization presents the opportunity for many existing ArcGIS Online users to take advantage of ArcGIS Online in new ways by now being able to work with and store United States federal data within ArcGIS Online in ways they may not have been able to before. If you are an ArcGIS Enterprise user, you may have some questions about what this enhanced authorization for ArcGIS Online means to you. If you are currently using ArcGIS Online, this may allow you to take advantage of the software in new ways such as working with data that policies previously did not allow to be stored in ArcGIS Online. If you are interested in using ArcGIS Online but haven\u2019t been able to use the product yet because your organization requires FedRAMP Moderate authorization, you may be able to start using ArcGIS Online. Another very common question ArcGIS Enterprise users have been asking is, \u201cDoes this mean ArcGIS Enterprise will soon be FedRAMP Moderate too?\u201d The short answer to this question is simply \u201cno\u201d. But instead of just leaving it at \u201cno\u201d, let\u2019s get into why the answer is no \u2013 which is exactly what we\u2019re going to do in this blog. We\u2019ll get into a bit of background about FedRAMP and how this affects (or doesn\u2019t affect) ArcGIS Enterprise. Understanding FedRAMP Moderate The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a United States government-wide program which provides a standard security baseline for Cloud Service Providers to store US federal data. This reusable set of security standards replaces redundant Agency security assessments with a \u201cdo once, use many times\u201d efficiency, maximizing staff and budget resources and promoting continuity across federal agencies. FedRAMP specifies multiple baseline levels of security for cloud systems hosting federal data. This includes Low, Medium, and High designations. If you\u2019ve never heard of FedRAMP before, that\u2019s okay. While significant in some industries, particularly United States federal government agencies, it isn\u2019t significant to all industries. What does it mean now that ArcGIS Online is FedRAMP Moderate? ArcGIS Online was designated FedRAMP Low in 2018 and was designated as FedRAMP Moderate earlier this year. If you\u2019re an ArcGIS Online user, you won\u2019t have to do anything extra to take advantage of this \u2013 everything is already available to you in ArcGIS Online. How ArcGIS Enterprise is affected ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise organizations have a similar look and feel. That is no surprise, because the two products share many features and applications. With this in mind, there is a misconception that now that ArcGIS Online is FedRAMP Moderate authorized, ArcGIS Enterprise soon will be too. But that is not the case. Remember when we mentioned earlier that FedRAMP Moderate is a designation for Cloud Service Providers? For ArcGIS Online, which is a software as a service (SaaS), the designated Cloud Service Provider is Esri. ArcGIS Enterprise is software installed on infrastructure that you control, meaning there isn\u2019t a singular Cloud Service Provider. You, or the organization running ArcGIS Enterprise on your behalf, are the Cloud Services Provider that must go through the security accreditation process. This means ArcGIS Enterprise itself cannot be authorized under the FedRAMP program. An authorization includes not just the software that is being run, but also the environment in which that software is maintained. ArcGIS Enterprise can only be as secure as the environment in which you install and run it. Thus, individual ArcGIS Enterprise deployments can be (and have been) set up and run in FedRAMP Moderate environments. Creating a FedRAMP Moderate compliant ArcGIS Enterprise deployment involves understanding not only where ArcGIS Enterprise is deployed in the cloud but also where the relevant data sources are hosted and the security controls surrounding that data and the rest of the software and cloud services that are used. Going through that process and accreditation is beyond the scope of this blog. For a deeper conversation, we encourage you to engage with your IT and security teams as well as Esri Professional Services. We hope this has helped provide a bit of clarity to how ArcGIS Online\u2019s FedRAMP Moderate status affects \u2013 or rather, doesn\u2019t \u2013 affect ArcGIS Enterprise.

    "summary": "ArcGIS Online has achieved FedRAMP Moderate authorization, allowing U.S. federal agencies to store and work with sensitive data in Esri's cloud-based GIS platform. However, this authorization does not extend to ArcGIS Enterprise deployments, as those are hosted on customer-controlled infrastructure. Individual ArcGIS Enterprise deployments can be configured to be FedRAMP Moderate compliant, but that requires assessing the full environment including data sources and connected systems.

Christa has high expectations for how she wants the water group to engage with customers and encourages her people to be on the front lines for messaging about everything going on in the water space including potable water, wastewater, irrigation, water resources, rivers, streams, lakes- everything relating to water up to the oceans she says. As Christa describes it, they create a wide array of content from conference sessions to webinars to articles in an effort to bring together outreach products that educate and inspire the water community around GIS. You can tell from our conversation that she is truly passionate about the issues the world is facing with regard to water. She is a huge advocate for her customers, but she also emphasizes how important the partners are to the mission. She believe that it is really important to help the water community because it is oftentimes underrepresented and has less awareness for their challenges than do other utility industries. The people working in the water sector do so much to improve our daily lives, our overall health, and the well-being of our planet, we really need to make their jobs easier however we can. One thing Christa especially enjoys is engaging with water professionals from around the world. She says they bring such an amazing perspective and she finds it really interesting to hear how they tackle challenges in their respective areas of the world. What was interesting to me about this was hearing her discuss the similarities of challenges in the water sectors around the world. While, of course, there are specific issues facing some communities, overall the topics people in this field are dealing with are very similar in nature. It felt very connective to hear Christa talking about common challenges across the water community around the globe. I had an incredible time chatting with Christa and I enjoyed my conversation with her beyond words. I learned so much about her experiences and what drives her to do this work in the water industry. Christa says, \u201cEsri makes you feel good about the work you\u2019re doing,\u201d and it\u2019s certainly a truth for me. Jack and Laura Dangermond make the world better; their leadership at Esri sets the bar high not only for their employees, but their customers and users around the world. They challenge us to find ways to do good for the planet, however we can. Christa definitely lives up to their example with her determination and motivation to help the water community, not only through her efforts at Esri, but also beyond.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 12, 2024 ArcGIS Experience Builder: Introducing Express mode By Bern Szukalski and Jianxia Song ArcGIS Experience Builder is a highly configurable solution for building compelling web apps without writing code. Choose a template and create an immersive web experience by including web maps, apps, pages, interconnected widgets, and both 2D and 3D data through a flexible drag-and-drop interface. About Express mode Express mode in ArcGIS Experience Builder is designed to make app building easy, enabling you to quickly and efficiently make engaging apps. Choose from a variety of templates to begin creating a new app, then follow the streamlined workflow to complete your experience. You can add and configure additional widgets in each layout template, select different themes, and preview apps in desktop and mobile views prior to publishing. You can move an experience from Express mode to Full mode if you need more advanced features and layout settings. Use Express mode to focus on essential functions and content when designing an experience. If you are familiar with ArcGIS Web AppBuilder, Express mode provides familiar template options and workflows for users newly migrating from Web AppBuilder to Experience Builder. The general steps for using Express mode to create your app are as follows: Sign in and open Experience Builder Go to Express mode Choose a template Add widgets and configure Choose a theme Save and publish See the sections below for more information on these steps. Open Experience Builder There are four ways you can open Experience Builder. Start from scratch 1 \u2013 Go to experience.arcgis.com and sign in to your ArcGIS account. 2 \u2013 Sign in to your organization and launch Experience Builder from the app launcher. Start from a map 3 \u2013 From the map item Overview, click Create Web App, then choose Experience Builder. 4 \u2013 Open Experience Builder from Map Viewer by clicking Create app on the Contents (dark) toolbar, then choosing Experience Builder. Go to Express mode Experience Builder has two modes for building apps: Express mode and Full mode. Express mode focuses on configuring the most essential features while Full mode provides access to all app editing features. Note that once you\u2019ve begun editing an app in Full mode, you cannot go back to Express mode. When you open Experience Builder, you should see the Express mode information window. If not, click the question icon next to the mode selector. When using Experience Builder, the last mode you worked in is persisted the next time you open it. To change modes, click the mode selector in the upper right. If you\u2019ve opened Experience Builder from the website or App launcher, click Create new to begin. An empty map will appear in a template. You\u2019ll need to configure a map for the Map widget later on. If you opened Experience Builder from Map Viewer or a map item, the map you launched it from will automatically appear in the template. Select a template Express mode currently supports nine different templates, similar to ones you may have used in Web AppBuilder. Tip: These same templates can be opened in Full mode by choosing the Web AppBuilder classic templates. The Express mode templates appear on the left, click any of them to view the map within the template. Once you\u2019ve chosen the template you want to use, click Create new app. Select or change the map If you started from scratch, you\u2019ll need to add a map. If you started with a map, you can change the map by selecting a new one. Click the map widget, then click Select map from the configuration panel on the right. Use the Select data pane that opens to search for and add a new or different map. Once your map is selected, you can explore and apply other settings found in the Map widget configuration panel. Configure and add widgets Each app template uses widgets and has one or more containers for widgets. The containers are also widgets; Widget Controller widgets that can be configured to include other widgets. In the templates some controllers already have ready-to-use widgets, others are empty and intended to be used to add and configure new widgets. For example, the default Foldable template has Legend, Map Layers, and Basemap widgets located in the controller in the upper right.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Nov 05, 2024 ArcGIS for AutoCAD enhances synchronization with ArcGIS Online By Michael Davidson A November 2024 release of ArcGIS for AutoCAD is now available for download. Enhancements for version 430.1.1 of the plug-in pertain exclusively to improving the user experience for editing and synchronization workflows. With these latest updates, CAD teams can more robustly synchronize edits to polylines and polygons making up hosted feature layers in ArcGIS Online. Background Working with curved geometry in CAD Projects across AEC, transportation, and other industries commonly require working with curved geometry. Design teams making use of Autodesk\u00ae AutoCAD\u00ae and Civil 3D\u00ae have the flexibility to draw various types of curves. Common types of curves that can be drawn in AutoCAD and Civil 3D include arcs, circles, ellipses, and splines. ArcGIS for AutoCAD support for editing true curves In ArcGIS, \u201ctrue curves\u201d can be edited using ArcGIS tools that support editing without approximating the curved geometry as densified line and vertex approximations. ArcGIS for AutoCAD supports editing and synchronization for a wide variety of curved geometry, such as for referenced layers in ArcGIS Enterprise. However, consideration should always be given when making use of curved geometry and web feature layers, such as those hosted in ArcGIS Online. Introduction of true curve support in ArcGIS Online (June 2024) The June 2024 release of ArcGIS Online introduced true curve support for hosted feature layers. This approach holds several advantages. For example, true curves take up less storage space and appear smoother. Serving as the introductory release of true curve support, hosted features defined as circular arcs in ArcGIS Online are supported. While the June 2024 release of ArcGIS Online introduced true curve support for circular arcs, support for other types of curves was not included. New configuration option in ArcGIS for AutoCAD for densifying curves A new configuration option in version 430.1.1 of ArcGIS for AutoCAD enhances the user experience when, for example, synchronizing edits from CAD to hosted feature layers in ArcGIS Online. Namely, the configuration option makes it so that curved geometry on any synchronized feature layers is automatically densified. This setting prevents instances where synchronization would fail, such as when attempting to synchronize non-circular curves to hosted feature layers on ArcGIS Online. To enable the configuration option, carry out the following steps: Issue the command: \u201cESRI_CONFIG\u201d. Select the \u201cDensify-curves\u201d option. Select \u201cYes\u201d. Whenever the \u201cDensify-curves\u201d option is set to \u201cYes\u201d, all curved geometry will be densified when synchronizing edits. To disable the configuration option, repeat steps 1 and 2 above, and then select \u201cNo\u201d. With this new configuration feature, ArcGIS for AutoCAD offers more robust support for both editing of true curves, and when needed, densifying curved geometry into line segments. Summary Version 430.1.1 of ArcGIS for AutoCAD is now available. This release focuses on increasing robustness for editing and synchronization workflows that warrant densification of curved geometry. ArcGIS for AutoCAD maintains robust support for synchronization and curved geometry via referenced layers in ArcGIS Enterprise. By adding a new configuration option to automatically densify curves, CAD teams can continue to smoothly transact on centralized datasets, such as those from ArcGIS Online, as part of integration workflows.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Sharing and Collaboration Nov 19, 2024 Unlocking AI-Driven Collaboration with the ArcGIS for Teams Copilot Plugin By Sean McGinnis Microsoft Copilot is a generative AI service that acts as an everyday AI companion. It provides a conversational chat interface helping users search for specific information, generate text such as emails and summaries, create images based on text prompts, and even write code in various programming languages. The ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin extends the natural language capabilities in Copilot to search for relevant apps, maps, and layers from ArcGIS. Users ask a question that contains a spatial element and the plugin extends the reach of Copilot and returns ArcGIS items as part of the response. Why should people be considering using Copilot? In 2022, the Harvard Business Review published How Much Time and Energy Do We Waste Toggling Between Applications?. The article discusses the significant amount of time and energy workers spend switching between different apps and websites to perform their tasks. The researchers found that workers toggled roughly 1,200 times each day, which adds up to just under four hours each week reorienting themselves after toggling \u2014 roughly 9% of their time at work every year! While many companies consider this a cost of doing business in a digital environment. It is often a choice made by the companies and managers about how work is done. Organizations are starting to recognize additional people will not fix bad processes and are looking to improve workflows causing the problems. How does it enable people to be more efficient? Copilot can significantly enhance efficiency by reducing time spent toggling between applications. By including the ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin in your broader AI strategy, users can discover, access, and share information securely, ensuring that only authorized content is available. By integrating tools and information within a single application, Copilot enables users to focus on the task at hand and reduces the mental workload associated with switching contexts. Within Teams, this seamless integration helps streamline workflows and enhances collaboration by allowing people to find and share information in ArcGIS the same way they would with a document, meeting, or message. How does it work? The Microsoft Copilot orchestrator sits between the end-user\u2019s natural language input and Copilot\u2019s natural language output. The orchestrator works to select and execute the right skill(s) from the right plugin(s) for the end-user\u2019s given task. When it detects a request looking for spatial information or applications within a specific scope \u2013 like ArcGIS, my organization, or my content \u2013 it will send the request to the ArcGIS Teams Copilot plugin to return the most relevant maps, apps, and layers. How secure is it? Copilot is built with a focus on security, compliance, and privacy, ensuring that it only provides content accessible to everyone at the organization. Within the ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin, it leverages a user\u2019s ArcGIS identity and only returns items they are authorized to access. None of your organization\u2019s items or data are mined into a datastore to provide the source of knowledge. The ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin sends the information against the ArcGIS search API to return the items most relevant to the question asked. Getting started There are a couple requirements to get started using the ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin. First, you will need to have a prerequisite base license assigned to access the Microsoft 365 Copilot. Second, you will need to have the ArcGIS for Teams component installed. If you need more detail on installing ArcGIS for Teams, please reference the Getting Started documentation. Access the plugin It is very easy to get started using the ArcGIS for Teams Copilot plugin when you have the Copilot license and ArcGIS for Teams app installed. The first step is to enable the plugin and then let Copilot handle the rest. After you have the correct licensing and the appropriate apps installed, click the \u2018Manage Copilot extensions\u2019 icon and enable the \u2018ArcGIS for Teams\u2019 extension in the Microsoft 365 Copilot message box. Using the plugin With the plugin enabled, you can begin to extend your Copilot responses from ArcGIS by including some key information the plugin is looking for. There are a couple key elements the plugin is looking for when processing the natural language: Keywords \u2013 phrases used to define the areas of interest to filter ArcGIS items Scope \u2013 limits extent of where the search is going to be performed. Current scopes include public, organization, group, or private. Some examples of requests that return information the user was looking for: Search ArcGIS for Africa SDG dashboards Search for biodiversity dashboards in ArcGIS Search for Public Safety Collaboration dashboards in my Organization Search for New Jersey Preserved Farms apps in ArcGIS Search for Pennsylvania soils",

Listen now Click on the audio player below to listen to this episode. (Listen on any of these platforms: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, PlayerFM, Podbean) Background Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) is a utility company that provides natural gas and electrical service to millions of customers across northern and central California. With 6,700+ miles of natural gas distribution lines, 18,000+ miles of electric distribution lines, and nearly continuous upgrades and maintenance projects, it\u2019s no surprise that an army of highly trained specialists supports PG&E\u2019s mission every day. What is surprising is how quickly these teams are embracing GIS as a way to collaborate with one another to be more efficient and reduce impacts on customers. Different perspectives drive the need to collaborate At first glance, Bill Parker and Travis Peterson are typical GIS Supervisors. They both manage teams that collect, store, analyze, and visualize data (electric for Bill and gas for Travis). They both build web applications and automations to keep data flowing around their teams and stakeholders. They both believe in the power of GIS to help people do their work and understand the impact that it makes. What makes them unique is that they both have experienced GIS across a wide range of industries and use cases. Bill\u2019s journey started as an archeologist in college, whereas Travis\u2019s started in the US Marine Corps surveying and analyzing data. Both transitioned into the private sector, dabbled in technology startups, and eventually found their way into PG&E. Travis summarizes his previous experience as having \u201cseen GIS through a few lenses\u201d which has helped him understand what his coworkers across the gas business need. Similarly, Bill views his time \u201cworking as a consultant in environmental\u201d as something that helped him see the differences in what biologists or transportation planners needed from GIS. In both cases, these wide-ranging experiences have helped both men see the wide range of needs that users place on a GIS. Transparency isn\u2019t always the way, but collaboration always is The first major insight that\u2019s clear from Bill and Travis is that their collaboration efforts are based on giving users what they need and what they can actually use (collaboration), not just giving everyone unfettered access to everything (transparency). This is not to say that transparency is bad, but just that in the context of PG&E\u2019s business that it isn\u2019t as valuable as collaboration. Bill highlights the focus on collaborating by focusing on the fact that \u201cthere\u2019s sometimes a lot of overlap between the requests that come into [his] electric group and Travis\u2019s gas group.\u201d Take for example the environmental team that needs to know where projects are happening from each side of the business. Both Bill and Travis could simply share the line feature layer that shows the highly detailed work that will happen. That transparency without the subject matter expertise to understand the data isn\u2019t valuable to PG&E staff. What\u2019s more important is to \u201cget these folks all talking and sharing and open those lines of communication\u201d with the help of GIS. That\u2019s collaboration and is why Bill and Travis worked together to build their GeoHub site that uses ArcGIS Hub and ArcGIS Online. It\u2019s a virtual place where base GIS data (streets, boundaries, imagery) can be found and where a more guided use of GIS can be curated. The GeoHub supports collaboration and communicates the vision The GeoHub is an internal-only Hub where Bill and Travis\u2019s teams can collaborate with staff through data, applications, and guided experiences. Through GeoHub, the GIS teams can: Share data: Eliminating duplication of data collection and purchase Highlight applications: Help staff self-serve by using embedded apps to answer their own simpler questions Guide users: To know when to contact a specific subject matter expert or team The site can do all of this because it relies on high quality metadata which does more than just describe what a specific piece of content is. This metadata and the narratives built around it help staff to be more confident about when to self-serve and when not to. Bill and Travis are continually monitoring the site and how it\u2019s being used to evaluate what content needs to be added or removed. The goal is to create a useful framework for collaboration, not just a site that continually grows without any pruning. Users are encouraged to share their data, applications, and insights back to Bill and Travis through the GeoHub to help make it more useful over time. This helps to balance the goals of both G",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Transportation Oct 30, 2024 Smart Airport: Streamlining Maintenance and Compliance with GIS By Michael Beavers and Silvia Pichler and Dylan Molnar As the aviation industry embraces innovation, smart airports are transforming operations by leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance airfield safety, regulatory compliance, and efficiency. For airports certified under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulation 14 CFR Part 139, Certification of Airports (Part 139), this means automating inspections, optimizing maintenance workflows, and managing airside operations with real-time data insights. Esri\u2019s suite of location-based tools enables airports to digitally manage inspections, streamline work orders, and monitor performance. From mobile data collection to integrated asset management, smart airports are revolutionizing how they function\u2014driving safer, more efficient, and more environmentally sustainable aviation. Streamlining Regulatory Compliance and Operational Efficiency Airports certified under FAA Part 139 face challenges of maintaining airfield safety, ensuring compliance, and maximizing operation efficiency. Esri\u2019s airfield operations tools streamline Part 139 airfield inspections, automate maintenance workflows, and provide real-time airside management insights. These tools, approved by the FAA, help airports meet requirements with secure, web-based dashboards that display discrepancies, real-time inspector locations, and work order status associated with issues. Streamlined Data Collection Leveraging configurable off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, airfield inspectors use tablets or mobile phones to conduct and log their daily Part 139 inspections. The form they use to log and report discrepancies is a simple survey that can be quickly configured to collect information about issues discovered during inspections, whether connected to the internet or offline. This survey mimics the inspector\u2019s existing data collection format, saving significant time and effort. Additionally, owning the data collected about airside issues is valuable, as it avoids the costs and restrictions associated with third-party vendors. The technology also links quickly to an airport\u2019s work order/asset management system (EAM), automating the generation of work orders and notifications for needed repairs, thus reducing the time and effort required to identify and address issues. Based on the same technology, airports are using a variation of this technology to satisfy the FAA requirement to conduct daily fueling inspections, as well as a variety of other non-Part 139 safety related checks. Whether on the airside or landside, it is becoming common practice to deploy field crews equipped with mobile devices, with ready-to-use Esri apps such as ArcGIS Field Maps, ArcGIS Quick Capture, and ArcGIS Survey123 to quickly collect authoritative information that can be consumed real-time via dashboard. This information helps managers quickly make location-based, data-driven decisions. Harnessing Indoor GIS for Efficient Facility Work Order Management Airports must carefully monitor and control infrastructure maintenance costs. Indoor GIS empowers employees with indoor maps and apps to locate and navigate to infrastructure needing inspection or service, report issues, and track and visualize maintenance. The basis of indoor GIS is indoor mapping, enabled through ArcGIS Indoors. Indoors allows airports to visualize their indoor spaces, assets, and people on floor-aware maps, meaning they are associated to specific sites, facilities, and floor levels. Floor-aware maps help airports identify the spatial distribution of work orders and prioritize them based on proximity, asset type, specific facilities, or individual floors within a facility. This optimization of resource allocation ensures timely completion of repairs. By integrating spatial data with work order management systems, GIS enables airports to efficiently track, prioritize, assign, and visualize work orders based on their locations, both indoors and outdoors. The ArcGIS Indoors web and mobile apps allow facilities managers and maintenance personnel to understand where maintenance is needed and underway. 360-degree photos provide a comprehensive view of the indoor environment and further help mobile workers understand local conditions within the facility to better prepare their maintenance work for efficient and effective services delivery. Inside airport terminals, conveyances such as elevators, escalators, and moving walkways are crucial components of critical infrastructure. When any of these conveyances are out of service, it can lead to delays, negatively affecting on-time performance and passenger satisfaction. In larger airports like Atlanta Hartsfield, monitoring the real-time operational status of conveyances can be challenging. When they become inoperative, facility managers can utilize ArcGIS Dashboards to check the status and location of these assets. Addit",

    "title": "ArcGIS Instant Apps: Introducing Observer",
    "date": "2024-11-06",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 06, 2024 ArcGIS Instant Apps: Introducing Observer By Sarah McDonald Observer is a new ArcGIS Instant Apps template that allows you to explore and learn about a web scene by using tools that filter and display statistics about data in the scene. Displaying data in 3D provides a more immersive way to visualize information, allowing users to better understand spatial relationships and the three-dimensional aspects of data, such as elevation and proximity. This app includes filter tools such as the attribute filter and time slider as well as a summary scoreboard tool to display statistics about the data in the scene. These tools allow app viewers to gain valuable insights about the content in the scene at a single glance. There are additional tools available in Observer to assist with navigating and exploring the app as well as tools to provide information about the app. The Observer app would be a great tool to use to visualize data for many use cases, such as the following: View the impacts of flooding over time on underground assets, such as pipelines. Summarize construction status, costs, or lease availability while viewing the development of buildings in a city or real estate assets. Compare the structural and financial impacts from an environmental event in an area of interest while visualizing the data. Set up a web scene The first step in having a successful Observer app, is setting up a web scene. Having a well-configured web scene improves the viewing experience of the app by having curated content that is accessible and straightforward. When configuring a web scene, there are certain elements that should be considered: Basemaps: Basemaps provide context and visual reference for the data being displayed. In ArcGIS Online, there are 3D basemaps available to use when setting up a scene. 3D basemaps contain layers\u2014such as buildings, labels, or trees\u2014that you can turn on and off. Layer visibility: Add layers that will display in the scene. Determine which layers are on and off when the scene loads. Symbology: Use smart mapping styles to communicate information through color, symbols, and patterns that enhance understanding and highlight key features or trends within data. Pop-ups: When a feature in the scene is clicked on a pop-up will open displaying attribute information from the data. Pop-ups can be configured to show in depth descriptions about features, attachments like images, or charts that show off graphic representations. Slides: Save snapshots of the web scene that show different views. Saving slides in a scene can help tell a story or focus in on the most important locations in a scene. Time: A time slider in a web scene allows users to visualize temporal changes and patterns in the data. This allows users to analyze patterns or trends and make informed decisions based on historical information. The Observer app has many tools that take advantage of the configured elements in a web scene. For example, the time filter tool uses the time configurations that are determined in Scene Viewer. Create an Observer app Once a web scene is saved, it can be used in an Observer app. To create an Observer app, start with the Instant Apps home page*. You can get to the home page from Scene Viewer, from the content page, or from the app launcher. Once the app is created, you will have the all the tools and settings that are available in the app. Some notable tools and settings include the following: Introduction window \u2013 A window that displays when your app first loads. Include text and images in the window to introduce users to your app or provide simple instructions on how to use it. Summary scoreboard \u2013 Display statistics based on attributes in layers to summarize data in the scene. Choose to use operators such as average, count, sum, maximum, and minimum value to calculate statistics for. Provide a label for each and choose a position and style for the scoreboard. You can float the scoreboard over the map or pin it to the edge of the app so the scoreboard fully spans the app. Attribute filter \u2013 Including attribute filters in your app allows users to interactively explore data by refining what is visible based on specific attributes. This allows users to focus on subsets of data and gain deeper insights into patterns and relationships in the scene. The attribute filter supports two types of filters: predefined and user input. Time filter \u2013 Use the time filter to take advantage of pre-configured time settings from the web scene. The slider in the time filter can be used to visualize temporal patterns and trends in data in the web scene, allowing users to interactively explore changes over time. Feature search \u2013 Find addresses and locate features in the scene. To refine search results, you can add a search source from layers in the map (and by URL), choose specific locators from your organization, and add a custom locator. Theme settings \u2013 Use the theme settings to adjust the default ",

    "date": "2024-11-25",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 25, 2024 Augmenting GEOGLOWS with River Names from OpenStreetMap By Gonzalo Espinoza Recently, the GEOGLOWS streamflow service was upgraded from v1 to v2. GEOGLOWS provides global river discharge forecast for 7 million river reaches for the next 10 days in 3-hour intervals. GEOGLOWS is a comprehensive service for the water resources and disaster response communities, but as it was developed globally, it does not include local river names. As part of the recent upgrade, the GEOGLOWS service in Living Atlas now displays river names from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The river names from OSM are obtained dynamically, meaning that GEOGLOWS will always display the latest information available. If missing river names in OSM are added, those will show up in the GEOGLOWS service. In this blog, I\u2019ll show you how information from OSM can be included in any layers using ArcGIS Arcade expressions such as in GEOGLOWS. Pop-up Configuration In the map viewer, we (1) select the GEOGLOWS layer, (2) open the pop-up panel, (3) make sure pop-ups are enabled, and (4) create a custom attribute expression. This attribute expression can be used within the (5) pop-up text. Attribute Expression We configure a custom attribute expression that can be added into the pop-up. The attribute expression includes three general steps: (1) intersect the GEOGLOWS river segments with the OSM Waterways, (2) filter the intersected river segments, and (3) select the river name and handle nulls. 1. Intersect GEOGLOWS river segments & OSM Waterways To get the OSM river name in the pop-up, we intersect the GEOGLOWS feature Geometry($feature)with the OSM waterways layer OSM_waterways_lyr: var rivers_intersect = Intersects(Geometry($feature), OSM_waterways_lyr); In which the OSM_waterways_lyr can be obtained with the FeatureSetByPortalItem function and the OSM Waterways item ID: The additional parameters specify the layer ID number (0), the required fields ([\"name\", \"name_en\"]), and if the geometry is returned (true). The OpenStreetMap (OSM) Waterways are divided into items per continents due the size of the geodatabse. The specific IDs for each continent are: North America \u201c7a7d92cef2c442c1a352d902e1f2f577\u201d Central America \u201caf162bf02efc4296878637a408f560df\u201d South America \u201c22783d44a7b0441c806c2977ff2800f3\u201d Africa \u201c82232d0415c04e7086414dff7eb1310f\u201d Europe \u201c7bf80080749e4806b936c2b39e73b62e\u201d Asia \u201c3b89b8d6cb2f4183b8a45defc06dc66b\u201d Australia & Oceania \u201c76659f9ea5bf4761b263ffe55f976d1a\u201d Note: The OSM waterways item ID is obtained dynamically in the final expression with an additional intersection between the feature geometry and the OSM Regions layer (i.e. continents). 2. Filter Features Then, we filter the river_intersect object, selecting features with valid names and features that describe a river such as stream, river, creek, dryriver, wadi, or drystream, this will prevent getting an erroneous name from other hydraulic structures such as dams or canals. 3. Select River Name Finally, we (1) handle empty responses (!IsEmpty(rivers)) , (2) discard null names using a When statement (When(!IsEmpty(river.name_en), river.name_en, !IsEmpty(river.name), river.name, \"Name not available\")), and (3) select the first feature (!First(rivers)) on the list. Live Expression See the complete attribute expression in the GEOGLOWS item. Missing River Names in OSM OpenStreetMap is an extensive dataset. Nevertheless, there are a few areas that are missing stream names. Those streams will display \u201cName not available\u201d in GEOGLOWS. We can take this opportunity to become an OpenStreetMap contributor. River names contributions to OSM will sync to the Live OpenStreetMap layers in Living Atlas within minutes. We can contribute to OSM, for example using the Rapid editor. In the course of time, the OSM river name contributions are shown in GEOGLOWS. Summary The GEOGLOWS streamflow service in Living Atlas includes river names from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The river names are displayed in the pop-up and retrieved on the fly using ArcGIS Arcade expressions. The OSM river names in GEOGLOWS display the latest data using the Live OpenStreetMap (OSM) hosted layers in Living Atlas.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 13, 2024 Convert ArcGIS Points to Adobe Illustrator Symbols in Two Simple Steps By Sarah Bell This post describes the steps for converting your ArcGIS Pro point symbols into Adobe Illustrator symbols with the newly released ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud 3.8. If you are already familiar with Adobe Illustrator symbols, then jump right to the steps. For readers who are just learning about Adobe Illustrator symbols, here are some quick facts about the convenience of these graphic design assets. What are Adobe Illustrator symbols? Adobe Illustrator symbols are a way to create and maintain reusable graphics for all sorts of graphic design. In that way, they are similar to ArcGIS Pro .STYLX files. In fact, users are provided with several Adobe Illustrator symbol libraries when they install Illustrator. But you can also create, maintain, and share your own custom symbol libraries. Explore more about Adobe Illustrator symbols. Adobe Illustrator symbols are stored in the Symbols panel (Window > Symbols), and can be saved as libraries as an .AI file. They work very well as cartographic points. Examine the CartographySymbols.ai file below as an example. The Symbols panel shows several icons, each with their own unique name. I dragged an instance of the Bike 1 symbol onto the Illustrator artboard (note: zoomed in 1600%). Users can place as many instances of a symbol to their artboard as they want. The benefit of converting ArcGIS Pro .AIX points to Adobe Illustrator symbols Let\u2019s go back to that bicycle symbol from above. Imagine that is the symbol that you use for all bike infrastructure across all maps. It\u2019s immediately apparent why storing this icon as a reusable symbol saves a lot of time. It eliminates the need to re-create the symbol every time you make a map. Many of you are GIS folks who use ArcGIS Pro to create custom point symbols for your organization or brand. If so, you probably also save those point symbols in a .STYLX file to reuse them in the future. With ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud 3.8, you can convert these point symbols into Adobe Illustrator symbols automatically. Here are some benefits of this workflow, followed by the two easy steps to convert your symbols. When opening an ArcGIS Pro-created .AIX file in Adobe Illustrator, the Symbols panel for that file is automatically populated with a reusable Adobe Illustrator symbol for each point layer. Adobe Illustrator symbols can be globally edited. This means that you can simultaneously update every symbol instance on your map by updating the symbol in the Illustrator Symbols panel. Multi-layered point symbols from ArcGIS Pro are grouped together in one singular \u201cinstance\u201d instead of being split into ungrouped Illustrator artwork. This allows for an increased ease of cartographic editing. Symbol instances require less memory than regular artwork. In cases where you have hundreds or thousands of points on your map, converting them to Adobe Illustrator symbols can lead to more performant files. Step 1 \u2013 Export an AIX file from ArcGIS Pro After designing your ArcGIS Pro project (must be version 3.4 or later), export the map or layout as an .AIX file. Of course, to convert ArcGIS point data to Adobe Illustrator symbols, your map needs to have points. In my map below, there are three point data layers: MajorDams, Amtrak Stations, and Washington State Ferry Terminals. Another new feature in ArcGIS Maps for Adobe 3.8, allows you to convert raster points into Adobe Illustrator symbols. For more information, and to learn how to replace these raster point symbols with new vector versions, read this newly published blog post. It\u2019s a fantastic new feature that I highly recommend exploring. But wait \u2014 there\u2019s more! I have also added the World Navigation vector tile basemap, which contains road shields and city point layers. Although you cannot see vector tile basemap layers listed in the ArcGIS Pro Contents pane, when you export an .AIX file, you will see all vector tile layers listed and organized in the Adobe Illustrator Layers pane. These points will also be converted to symbols. Note that sprites are raster images. Read this new post to learn about the new vector road shields symbol library provided with Maps for Adobe 3.8. To export an .AIX file from ArcGIS Pro, go to the Share tab and select Export Map or Export Layout. Then select AIX as the file type. Find more information about exporting .AIX files here. Step 2 \u2013 Opt to convert points to symbols After installing ArcGIS Maps for Adobe 3.8, the first time you open an ArcGIS Pro-exported AIX file that contains points, you will see an alert asking if you would like to convert your points to Adobe Illustrator symbols. Choosing Yes will complete the conversion. Your selection will be saved in the application settings, and you can update them at any time. That\u2019s it! In fact, it\u2019s really only one step \u2013 a new setting in ArcGIS Maps for Adobe. Continue reading to learn about the",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 13, 2024 Swap out your raster symbols for vector symbols in Adobe Illustrator By Ashley Kuhn This blog will discuss the latest updates to the symbol replacement tool in ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud version 3.8. You can now replace raster image point symbols with Adobe Illustrator symbols from an Illustrator symbol library. Not only can you replace raster points from feature layers, but also raster sprites from Esri Vector Tile Basemaps exported from ArcGIS Pro 3.4. To learn more about other new features in ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud 3.8, check out the blogs, What\u2019s new in ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud (November 2024) and Convert ArcGIS Points to Adobe Illustrator Symbols in Two Simple Steps. What are sprites? Vector tile basemaps can include sprites, which are small graphic files used in basemaps for road symbols, icons, and texture patterns. All sprites are raster images, which are not ideal for editing in a vector-based software like Adobe Illustrator. While they look great in ArcGIS Pro, sprites brought into Illustrator can appear pixelated compared to the vectors in the map. With the updated symbol replacement tool, you can automatically replace your raster points with vector symbols that can be easily customized and globally edited. How to replace highway shield sprites with vector symbols Start by opening an .aix file exported from ArcGIS Pro 3.4 that has the World Navigation basemap. When opening an .aix from ArcGIS Pro 3.4 in Adobe Illustrator, if you choose to convert ArcGIS point symbols to Illustrator symbols, the vector sprites from your basemap will appear in the symbols panel. To learn more about Illustrator symbols, go to Sarah Bell\u2019s blog Convert ArcGIS Points to Adobe Illustrator Symbols in Two Simple Steps. In this example, I have a map of Hospitals in Downtown Seattle, Washington. In the Illustrator layers panel (Window > Layers) pictured below, notice the updated layer structure of the points and labels. The symbol part of the road shield is separated from the text, which makes replacing the shields easy. To find the symbol replacement tool, open the ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud extension and go to the Processes panel. In the ArcGIS Maps: Compilation window, click the Processes button. The Symbols process allows you to replace default map symbology with custom styles and symbols from your Adobe Illustrator libraries. When you install ArcGIS Maps for Adobe Creative Cloud, your download includes the World Navigation.ai symbols library. This library contains vector versions of all the highway shields in the World Navigation basemap. You can find this library in the Illustrator files under Presets > en_US > Symbols > ArcGIS Maps. Enter the file path to the World Navigation symbol library and click Replace Symbols. The new vector road shield symbols are added to the Symbols panel and all the road shields on the map are replaced with the vector version. How this workflow applies to other basemaps and symbol libraries You don\u2019t have to use just the World Navigation symbol library provided. Any sprite, from any basemap, can be swapped out with symbols from your own custom libraries. In my example, there is another sprite in the basemap for rail stations. To use your own library for symbol replacement: Create your symbols in Illustrator. I found the rail stations icon from the Esri Developer site. Add the symbol to the symbols panel. You can add many symbols to the panel, but for this example, I\u2019m just adding this rail station icon. Make sure the symbol you create has the same name as the layer you are planning to replace. Click the menu icon to save the symbols library as an .ai file. Run symbol replacement again with the custom library path. For additional help with Adobe Illustrator symbols, check out this video by Sarah Bell on Creating Adobe Illustrator Symbols & Libraries.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 04, 2024 Visualize voting trends in 20 years\u2019 worth of U.S. election data By Kristian Ekenes At the 2023 Esri Developer Summit, I demonstrated various ways to visualize data as it changed over time in this technical session. The session covered common approaches for visualizing change including animations, composite multivariate symbology, and small multiples. Many of these examples used election data to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. After the session, an attendee approached me with an idea she had sketched on a piece of paper. The idea was to visualize the results of multiple elections using square symbols where each square represented the winner of an election using color. The sketch looked something like the following. The sketch resembled a mini timeline for each election, similar to a sparkline map, but instead using categorical data. The thought was that we could create a bivariate symbol for each of the five previous elections. Intrigued, I knew we could accomplish a visual like this using CIM symbols, but I didn\u2019t attempt it until early this year. Prototyping the idea With the next United States presidential election just around the corner, I felt it was worth sharing how my attempt at this idea turned out. There\u2019s still more work to do in the app, but the core concept behind the symbology is in place. Check it out here! Change over time visualization techniques To learn more about various ways to visualize change over time in web apps, check out these resources: Six ways to visualize change over time in web maps Data-driven map animations for the web This map shows the results of the previous five U.S. presidential elections (i.e. 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020). Each square represents the election winner for the given area. The right-most square represents the result of most recent election in 2020. Each square represents the winner of a single election for the given area; its size is proportional to the margin of victory for the winner. Smaller squares indicate a close election while larger squares show a larger margin of victory. Using size to represent margin of victory allows us to see areas with more consequential results than areas with smaller vote totals. This tends to result in areas with higher populations showing larger symbols than less populated areas. However, in rare scenarios a highly populated area can render with smalls symbols if the election results are very close. In the popup, I added a table along with several charts to give the user the ability to dive into specific election results. Layout and app design All thematic maps have their strengths and weaknesses. Multivariate thematic maps tend to take more effort and time to understand that single variable maps. Therefore, they typically require more information in the layout explaining how the reader should interpret map symbology. I decided to use collapsible box components in a side panel to teach the audience how to read the map. The first component describes the symbology in detail and displays a custom legend. The second component describes and contrasts four different patterns of symbols. This helps the audience learn how to identify common trends and outliers based on variations in the symbology. This visualization is complex and as a result inherits all the problems present in other multivariate visualizations. Anytime you map more than one variable, the audience\u2019s cognitive load for understanding the map increases. The margin of victory represented for each symbol is represented by variations in each marker\u2019s area. It is more difficult for map audiences to understand variations in area than in length and height. So using some kind of a bar chart symbol might actually yield better comprehension of the map. For that reason, I include bar charts in showing results for margins of victory and results from the major parties in each election. Explore the data The symbol sizes are scale driven. As the user zooms in, symbols grow to become more visible. As the user zooms out, they shrink as the screen\u2019s real estate becomes scarce. Once a scale threshold is reached, data switches from displaying state results to county results. This provides more detail that allows the audience to explore nuances on a local scale. Let\u2019s explore voting trends in a few areas below. How it\u2019s made Conceptually, creating this visualization involves a lot of trial and error. On a technical level, the symbology is created with CIMSymbols containing various primitive overrides to override the color and size of each square in the symbol using data values. First, you must create a CIMSymbol with 5 square symbol layers of equal size. Each symbol layer must be given a primitive name to easily identify it when writing primitive overrides. I chose to name each symbol layer using the following pattern: election-{year}. Each symbol layer must have the following offsetX values so the boxes evenly displ",

With our latest update, you can use custom URL parameters to optimize that experience. Use URL parameters to set the initial extent of the map, zoom in to a specific location, a feature, and more. In this article, we\u2019ll cover the basics of URLs, explore URL parameters in Web Editor, and review some best practices. Let\u2019s dig in. URL Parameters 101 In this section, we\u2019ll cover some basics to set the stage for using URL parameters with applications like Web Editor. If you already know your way around a URL parameter, we recommend you skip ahead to Section 2: URL Parameters in Web Editor. A URL is essentially a web page address. Let\u2019s take a basic address\u2026 you can think of it as the cake: 101 Easy Street Next, we\u2019ll add extra details like an Apartment number. You can think of that as the icing: 101 Easy Street, Apt A If this were a web address, it might look like this: Notice the question mark (?) in the example. Everything before the question mark is the basic address, or the cake. Everything after the question mark is a parameter, or the icing. Key-Value Pairs Parameters contain a key, an equals sign (=), and a value. In technical jargon, these are referred to as key-value pairs, that look like key1= value1. In the example above, Apt=A, the key is Apt, and the value is A. Together, they form the key-value pair Apt=A. In the next example, the key is web map, and the value is the alphanumeric code, or web map ID, that follows: Mix and Match Parameters You can string multiple parameters together by placing an ampersand (&) between the key-value pairs, like so: key1=value1&key2=value2 URL Parameters in Web Editor Web Map URL In Web Editor, everything begins with a web map. You add editable layers to a web map in Map Viewer, style the layers, and configure elements like labels and forms. When the map is polished and ready for editing, you open it in Web Editor. The address bar contains a URL that serves as a unique identifier for that map in Web Editor. Like fingerprints, no two URLs are alike. With some basic copy and paste skills, you can share a web map URL with others so they can open the same web map directly in Web Editor. To copy the web map URL: Open the map in Web Editor Place the cursor in the Address bar Right click and select Copy (or Ctrl+C) Next, Paste the URL into a document where you can view and customize it Your webmap URL might look something like this, with a few differences reflecting your organization and the webmap ID: Now that you have the basic address, you can add additional parameters to control specific map behaviors. In Web Editor, you can use URL parameters to: Open a specific web map Define the map extent Zoom to a location Zoom to a feature, and Connect to a specific version Remember to string additional parameters together using the ampersand (&). 1. Open a Web Map To launch a specific web map in Web Editor use the key webmap and the web map ID. Hint: To find a web map ID, see the previous section on Web Map URLs. Key-value pair: webmap=webmap ID https://organization.example.com/portal/apps/webeditor/?webmap=1cc837149e4c40c5a326c1495d7aa239 2. Define the Map Extent To set the initial map extent, use the key extent, then specify the coordinates separated by a comma. The coordinates can be in either a geographic or a projected coordinate system. When using a projected coordinate system, be sure to include the Well Known ID or WKID. Key-value pair for a Projected Coordinate System: extent=MinX,MinY,MaxX,MaxY,WKID Key-value pair for a Geographic Coordinate System: extent=MinX,MinY,MaxX,MaxY https://organization.example.com/portal/apps/webeditor/?webmap=1cc837149e4c40c&extent=-117.20,34.055,-117.19,34.06 3. Zoom to a Location To zoom to a specific location upon opening the map, use the key find, followed by an address, city, or country. Key-value pair: find=redlands https://organization.example.com/portal/apps/webeditor/?webmap=1cc837149e4c40c&find=redlands 4. Zoom to a Feature To zoom to a specific feature in a searchable layer upon opening the map, use the key find followed by an attribute value in the searchable field. Hint: Enable Search By Layer on the web map beforehand. Key-value pair: find=Prospect Hill https://organization.example.com/portal/apps/webeditor/?webmap=1cc837149e4c40c&find=Prospect%20Hill 5.

    "date": "2024-11-15",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 15, 2024 The grid: A snappy new editing tool in ArcGIS Online By Bekah Bollin The ArcGIS Online November 2024 update introduces a snappy new way to edit features: the grid. Just as the name implies, the grid consists of horizontal and vertical grid lines that can be used as a reference guide to snap to while drawing features. The grid will be available in ArcGIS Online applications that support editing or sketching features, such as Map Viewer, ArcGIS Web Editor, and more. This blog will cover the following: An introduction to the grid Grid settings Notes for consideration An introduction to the grid If you have used ArcGIS Pro for any of your GIS editing needs, you might already be familiar with the grid. The grid can be used as a visual aid and as a snapping tool to create straight lines and even spacing between features. The grid can both snap to pre-existing features during placement and be used as a snapping source while editing features. For example, to create an office footprint that is aligned with a pre-existing feature you can first snap the grid to the desired polygon edge. Once the grid is configured it will become a snappable source for all eligible layers in your map. Grid settings Let\u2019s take a look at how to set up and optimize the grid while editing. Placement options At the top of the Grid settings, you will see a category of Placement options. The Place tool allows you to manually set the origin of the grid, its spacing, and rotation all at once. This tool is particularly useful when aligning the grid to pre-existing features or establishing the grid spacing in a specific area of the map. You can set the grid origin using the Move tool or define the angle with the Rotate tool. If you have specific values that you would like to use, you can enter the numbers in the Angle and Spacing* inputs. *The spacing input is only available when editing a dataset in a projected coordinate system other than Web Mercator. This is to prevent distortion while editing. See notes for consideration for more information. Dynamic scaling Dynamic scaling refers to the size of the grid and its spacing being automatically adjusted when you zoom in or out of the map. This setting is enabled to prevent the grid from becoming too condensed at different scales. To see the change in the grid spacing when dynamically scaled, hover over the Spacing tooltip (pictured below). However, there are times when it may be useful to keep consistent grid spacing regardless of the map scale. Simply toggle off Dynamically scale grid based on zoom* to ensure the spacing input is honored. *When dynamic scaling is disabled, the grid will automatically turn off to prevent grid lines from becoming too condensed. Additional settings Explore the following settings to fine tune the grid while editing. Theme The Theme category of grid settings allows you to set the color of the grid lines. This can be particularly helpful for different basemaps styles or layers with imagery to increase readability and accessibility. There are three options to choose from: a Dark theme, Light theme, and a custom color option to choose the exact color of preference. Rotate grid with map Just as the name states, control whether the grid rotates with the map or remains stationary by toggling the Rotate grid with map setting on or off. Cells between major lines The Cells between major lines setting differentiates the thicker or \u201cbolder\u201d grid lines from the default line style. Entering a specific number (up to 15) can both reduce visual clutter of the grid and allow you to quickly count grid spaces while digitizing features. Notes for consideration 1. To ensure that the grid can snap to desired layers and features, configure the layer snapping under Snapping options. 2. The grid is composed of straight, flat lines that lay on top of a projected map. Due to the nature of projections, there may be slight distortions in the grid spacing as you edit further away from the equator. Manually entering spacing for the grid will be unavailable when editing data in a Geographic Coordinate System or Web Mercator to prevent inaccuracy while editing. To get the highest accuracy and precision while editing your GIS data, create a custom basemap using a projected coordinate system (other than Web Mercator) suitable for your area of interest. 3. The grid is currently only supported for 2D editing. To learn more about what is new for the November 2024 update, see the following blogs.

From the Contents (dark) toolbar in Map Viewer, simply click on Embed map to open the configuration setting (Note \u2013 if your web map is not shared publicly, you will be prompted here to update the sharing settings). The embed window provides a preview of how your embedded map will look. As you adjust the settings, you will see them automatically reflected on the preview map. Choose the settings that make the most sense for your web site and map. Once you have selected the settings you want, simply click the Copy HTML button to copy the code required to embed your map. The copied HTML code contains a script tag and the custom element with the map to embed. The script tag should be pasted into the <head> of your page. The custom element should be added to the <body> of your page where you want the map to appear. Both are required for the embedded map to display. Once copied, you can further edit the code if needed to change the size, remove map elements you no longer want, or even swap out the web map ID. In this example, I\u2019ve created a basic website documenting some adventures on the Trans Canada Trail and I\u2019d like to embed this Trans Canada Trail map from the Living Atlas. I\u2019ll start by pasting the first part of the Map Viewer output to the top of my page: Next I\u2019ll copy the final part of the code into the <body> of my site to see the map: You can embed multiple maps into a single site, and remember \u2013 you can customize the size as well. In my example, I\u2019ve decided to include a small map at the top showing the boundary of Fundy National Park. Simply paste in the code the same way and adjust the height and width values as needed. This new component approach means that your website does not need to load an entire application (as the iframe approach does) for each embedded web map, improving overall loading performance. Developers can learn more about the underlying Embedded Map component here. It is worth noting that this new embed approach does not use iframes, which may limit the types of web sites you can embed this content in for some users. If your site requires the use of iframes to embed content, you can create a simplified map using one of the ArcGIS Instant Apps and copy the embed code for it instead. The ArcGIS Instant Apps option is also ideal for users who require specific functionality, want to embed maps with subscriber content, or who want to further customize the tools and settings visible on the map. Media Map in particular, is designed with embedding in mind. This is just the first step in our ongoing improvements and enhancements to map sharing from Map Viewer. We will continue to explore adding additional map elements to the embed configuration and improving sharing options for non-public maps.

    "date": "2024-11-13",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 13, 2024 Table Talk: Explore and control more with attachment management and table configuration By Lauren Ballantyne Map Viewer is used to create visually rich and informative maps. To achieve this, you need to know the data. For many, data exploration starts by viewing the data in tabular form. This makes the attribute table a valuable resource when curating layers for your maps. By default, the attribute table shows everything, but map consumers can quickly become overwhelmed by too much information. We\u2019re excited to announce that the 2024 fall update of ArcGIS Online brings new functionality enhancements that will help streamline the attribute table experience. This includes viewing and managing attachments and the ability to configure, save, and reuse the visibility, order, and sorting of columns in a feature layer\u2019s or table layer\u2019s attribute table. Attachment management Attachments are a key piece when contextualizing many datasets. They can include images that confirm the associated attributes or reports that detail procedures, among other options. Because attachments are important to so many of you, we\u2019ve built an enriched experience that will improve attachment exploration and management. Attachment viewing Previously, the attribute table in Map Viewer only displayed the number of attachments per record. That same attachment column now previews the first 8 attachments per record. Clicking on an attachment cell opens a complete list of attachment for the selected record. In the list you have access to the file size and the option to download or view the attachment. Attachment management actions If you\u2019re the layer owner, organization administrator, or have the appropriate editing permissions you can manage attachments directly from the attribute table. The following management actions are available: Add an attachment by selecting or dragging and dropping a file Update an attachment to retain attachment order Delete an individual attachment or bulk delete selected attachments Table configuration Map Viewer now allows you to save attribute table display settings. You can configure column visibility, order, and sorting for a feature layer or table layer. This is incredibly useful when curating a map to tell a specific story or to meet the data needs of a particular group of people. This new functionality is possible because of the new attributeTableInfo property in the web map specification. To learn more, check out the web map specification. Let\u2019s look at each configuration option in more detail. Column visibility Configuring column visibility ensures that your audience has the information they need to understand the dataset and draw conclusions. Column visibility can be set on fields, attachment columns, and related record columns. In the species observations map below, I\u2019m refining the attribute table to match the map theme by only including species identification information, like species names, identification agreement/disagreement votes, and attachments. Column order Setting column order allows you to prioritize important information and help your data flow. You can also improve readability by placing related fields together. For example, below I\u2019m reordering the fields so that the number of identification agreements is beside the disagreements for easy comparison. Data sorting Sorting field data, in ascending or descending order, helps organize the data in a meaningful or intuitive way and can help highlight patterns. For instance, I can sort the taxon field so that the records are grouped by taxon like they are in the map. Persisting table configuration Save the web map once you\u2019ve made the desired changes to the column visibility, order, and sorting. This will ensure that others viewing the map will see the attribute table as you configured it. If you want to reuse the attribute table configurations set on a layer in other maps, save the changes to the layer item through the properties panel. For more details, see the layer properties documentation. Table functionality in ArcGIS Online The attribute table of many ArcGIS Online applications, like Map Viewer, are built from the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript FeatureTable widget. We are putting an emphasis on building as much functionality as possible into the FeatureTable. This includes attachment management and table configuration. Building this into the FeatureTable ensures similar functionality and familiarity across applications, whether they\u2019re custom or made with in-house apps like ArcGIS Instant Apps. In future ArcGIS Online updates, other areas like the Data tab of the items details page plan on incorporating the FeatureTable to further achieve functional harmony in the web. What\u2019s next We\u2019re excited to have brought more functionality and level of configuration to the attribute table, but we certainly aren\u2019t done. We have big plans and look forward to delivering more key features. In future updates of Map",

    "title": "The New SQL Field Calculate Experience",
    "date": "2024-11-12",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 12, 2024 The New SQL Field Calculate Experience By Taylor McNeil In the June 2024 update we introduced a new way to calculate field values in Map Viewer. At that time, Arcade was the only supported language within the new experience. Fast forward to today, we\u2019re excited to announce full SQL support for calculating field values in Map Viewer with the November 2024 update. As part of this work, we\u2019ve also built a new SQL editor for authoring expressions. Keep reading to learn more about the new SQL calculate field experience in Map Viewer. When should you use SQL? SQL calculations are more performant compared to calculations that use Arcade, particularly when you\u2019re working with a dataset with many features. As a result, we recommend using SQL to calculate your field values when possible. For example, if your calculation does not require spatial attributes (e.g., feature geometry) or comparison with other features in the dataset. Additionally, if your layer has editing settings like Sync or Change tracking enabled, SQL is the only supported language to calculate field values. Calculating fields with SQL The workflow and steps to calculate fields with SQL is virtually identical to Arcade field calculation. If you haven\u2019t already, check out this blog post first for an overview of the various pieces of functionality available to you throughout the workflow. After selecting SQL as the calculation language, you will have the ability to set a filter on your calculation. This is an optional step in the workflow, but can be particularly helpful if you want to refine which features will receive the calculated value. You can think of the filter as a WHERE clause for your SQL expression. Only features that meet the condition(s) outlined in the WHERE clause will be impacted by the calculation. After the optional filter step, you\u2019re ready to start authoring your SQL expression! Just like Arcade, you\u2019ll be able to preview your calculation result prior to running the expression using the preview pop-up and table. If you\u2019ve used SQL to calculate fields in the Data tab, you may recall that there was a button to check the validity of your expression prior to execution. In the new experience, we don\u2019t have an explicit button to check this. Instead, the validity of your expression is periodically evaluated as you author it in the editor. If your expression is valid, you will be allowed to run the expression on the full dataset using the Run calculation button. The SQL expression editor The new SQL expression editor incorporates all the features you know and love from the Arcade editor into a new and exciting SQL calculation experience. Syntax highlighting The SQL expression editor leverages the same color palette as the Arcade editor for highlighting syntax elements. Accordingly, all colors used in the editor are compliant with WCAG 2.0 guidelines for maintaining sufficient contrast between foreground and background element colors. Validation & auto-completion The editor will help you validate your SQL expression by flagging invalid field names, unsupported characters, or missing function parameters. As you type in the editor suggestions for functions, snippets, and layer fields will appear based on the characters you\u2019ve entered. Additionally, certain keywords will display as options for function parameters where appropriate. For example, when using the EXTRACT() function relevant keywords like YEAR, MONTH, DAY, etc. will appears as options in the suggestions menu for the part_ parameter. Integrated documentation Detailed documentation for all supported SQL functions can be accessed using the Functions button in the side panel. The documentation includes descriptions of each function, the expected return type(s), required parameters, and example code snippets. You can also insert a function snippet with parameter placeholders by selecting the Insert button on the bottom of the function\u2019s documentation page. Layer fields The Fields button in the side panel will display an overview of your layer\u2019s fields, including their type, alias, and field name. If you have domains or subtypes configured on your fields, you can also view these by drilling into the field using the > button. Pro tip: The width of the editor can also be increased or decreased by clicking and dragging with the mouse on the right-hand side of the editor. If the editor is under a certain minimum width, the side panel will be hidden to provide you with more space to author your expression. If you don\u2019t see the side panel, increase the width of the editor until it appears. Conclusion The new SQL calculate field experience should behave exactly the same as the previous experience still found in the Data tab. If you have existing workflows or SQL expressions that you use to calculate fields you can bring them into the new experience in Map Viewer seamlessly. In future updates of ArcGIS Online, we plan to continue to improve the field calc",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 12, 2024 Monitoring algae bloom concentration in turbid water bodies with raster functions in Map Viewer By Sucheta Bhattacharjee and Ling Tang Monitoring algae bloom concentration in turbid waterbodies using satellite imagery is crucial for monitoring environmental health, as algae blooms can degrade water quality and harm aquatic life. Satellites like Landsat, Sentinel-2, NAIP and many other can detect chlorophyll concentrations and other indicators of algae presence through specific spectral bands, allowing for early detection and monitoring. ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World offers several satellite-based imagery layers, many of which include multiple time periods, providing a comprehensive view of the study area. By leveraging these satellite imagery, we can efficiently identify and monitor blooms in turbid waters. This blog will guide you through the process of using Image collection explorer in combination with a Raster function template (RFT) to identify areas with higher concentration of algae over time. The Monitoring Algae Bloom Concentration In Turbid Water bodies raster function template from the Living Atlas will be used to identify the algae blooms. The detailed workflow for selecting imagery through the Image collection explorer is covered in another blog here. Background The algae concentration monitoring will be accomplished through water quality indicators to detect the water present in the imagery and the chlorophyll concentration within the water. The NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) will be used to detect water and the chlorophyll concentration will be determined with the NDCI (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index). By comparing these indices across two years change detection techniques can reveal patterns and growth trends in algal bloom presence. Requirements To complete this tutorial, you will need to have an ArcGIS Online account to add the imagery layer to a web map and you will need to have a Professional, or Professional Plus user type, which you will need to perform raster analysis. Study area The study area is Clear Lake, California, which is an ideal location for studying algae blooms due to its large size, relatively shallow depth, and history of frequent algal blooms. A time period between August and October is more suitable, because warmer water temperatures and increased nutrient levels typically lead to more frequent and intense blooms. Which satellite sensors are compatible This RFT is compatible with various satellite sensors that capture key spectral bands for analysis. Commonly used imagery layers include Sentinel-2 MSI, which offers high-resolution imagery with red-edge band (Band 5), which is more suitable towards this analysis. Landsat and NAIP provide red and near-infrared bands for medium and high resolution analysis of chlorophyll and water quality. Although near-infrared can sometimes yield low or unclear values over water, masking land areas and isolating water bodies can help reduce interference and get more accurate results. Workflow Step 1: Prepare the layer The analysis layer should include key spectral bands for analysis. If you\u2019re adding imagery from Living Atlas, start by setting the layer\u2019s default processing template to \u2018None\u2019 in the Map Viewer, to ensure that all the bands are available for the analysis workflow. You can access it through the Processing Templates pane on the Settings (white) toolbar. Once this setup is complete, use the Style pane to confirm that all required bands are available for analysis. Step 2: Access Raster Function Template in Map Viewer Raster function templates can be accessed in the Map Viewer through the Analysis Pane, which is on the Settings (white) toolbar. The RFT can be opened by selecting either the Raster Functions tab or by navigating to the Raster Function Templates tab. Once you are in one of these tabs, click to open or browse the raster function template, and change the selection group to the Living Atlas, where you will find a list of shared list of RFTs from which you can add the Monitoring Algae Bloom Concentration In Turbid Waterbodies. Once this step is completed, the RFT should appear as shown in the image below. Step 3: Compute algae concentration Once you open the raster function template you can see various raster functions has been used to analyze the algae bloom concentration in this study area. First, we have used Band Arithmetic function to create a NDWI or MNDWI index. Since the focus is on water areas, we have created a mask using the Calculator function. This has been applied to retain only those pixels where value are greater than zero, effectively isolating water bodies and excluding land areas from the analysis. Next, to detect algae blooms chlorophyll index has been calculated using the Band Arithmetic function. For this analysis, we have applied the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) method, using the red (Band 4) and red-edge",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Oct 07, 2024 Introducing ModelBuilder in Map Viewer (beta release) By Jian Lange Are you a GIS analyst, business analyst, or instructor using ArcGIS Online\u2019s analysis tools to solve spatial problems or integrate location intelligence into your data analysis? We have exciting news: ModelBuilder is coming to ArcGIS Online in the November 2024 update! Designed for users who prefer a no-code approach, ModelBuilder helps to streamline your workflows using intuitive visual diagrams directly within Map Viewer. What is ModelBuilder? ModelBuilder allows you to build models that chain analysis tools and data together, where the output of one tool becomes the input for another. Models are used to create multi-step workflows, ranging from routine tasks like managing spatial data to complex analysis workflows. With ModelBuilder, you can: Automate Analysis Workflows: Build models by adding and connecting analysis tools and data without writing code. Once a model is built, you can run it repeatedly to streamline tasks and reduce errors. Document and Communicate: A model provides a visual, step-by-step interface, allowing users to see exactly how it was built. You can see the specific parameters applied for every tool used in ModelBuilder and the input and output for each step. Improve performance: During model execution, only the temporary intermediate datasets are generated by each tool before the final output, eliminating the performance bottlenecks of creating an output hosted feature layer after every tool. Check out the video below to see ModelBuilder in action. Join the ModelBuilder Early Adopter Program ModelBuilder is in beta, and we invite you to join the Early Adopter Community (EAC). Here, you can share your experiences and access additional resources, including a getting started tutorial, FAQs, and other latest announcements on features and functionalities. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please post in the ModelBuilder EAC forums. Our team is happy to help you out! Get started with ModelBuilder You can access ModelBuilder from the Analysis pane within Map Viewer. To use ModelBuilder, you will need an ArcGIS Online subscription account with either Professional or Professional Plus user types. To build a model, users must connect to an analysis session that provides compute resources in the cloud to power ModelBuilder operations such as authoring and running a model. Credits are charged based on how long you are connected to the analysis session, similar to session-based credit consumption in ArcGIS Data Pipelines and ArcGIS Notebooks. You can track the number of credits consumed during your ModelBuilder session directly in the ModelBuilder pane and at the top of the Map Viewer. For more details on how and when ModelBuilder consumes credits, please refer to the ModelBuilder FAQ on licensing requirements available in the ModelBuilder Early Adopter Community. Build models by integrating data and tools ModelBuilder\u2019s interactive authoring environment simplifies the creation and execution of models. You can visually connect data and tools to form models. For instance, draw lines to designate input datasets for selected tools, or use the auto-layout option to automatically arrange model components, making the workflow more understandable. Validation occurs automatically during the authoring process, ensuring that all model elements\u2014including data sources and tool parameters are in a \u201cready-to-run\u201d state. Once your model is complete, you can run the model. This streamlined approach not only boosts efficiency but also enhances the transparency and reproducibility of your spatial analyses. Input Data ModelBuilder supports feature layers and hosted tables as input data. Users can easily select layers directly from the web map or browse available data sources, including ArcGIS Living Atlas. When adding layers from the web map, you can select a subset of data by applying an attribute filter using Map Viewer\u2019s filter option. This attribute filter will carry over to the model tool input, ensuring that only the features that meet the selection criteria are used as inputs in the model. Tools Most feature analysis tools available in Map Viewer are supported for inclusion in a model, with additional tools expected in future releases. For a complete list of the tools available in the initial beta release of ModelBuilder, please refer to the FAQ section in the ModelBuilder Early Adopter Community. This resource will keep you informed about the current capabilities and upcoming enhancements. Model Outputs By default, each tool in a model generates temporary, intermediate data outputs that are essential for the workflow, serving as inputs for subsequent tools. These datasets are not intended for long-term storage and are typically deleted after the model finishes running. Using intermediate data helps to optimize performance and avoids creating unnecessary hosted layers. To preserve interm",

    "date": "2024-10-17",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog 3D Visualization & Analytics Oct 17, 2024 3D Object Layer: A Comprehensive Overview By Nikola Marincic In web GIS, the demand for managing a wide variety of 3D data is rapidly growing. The support for 3D models is especially important due to their widespread use across various industries. Thus far, scene layers have been the means to address this demand. However, this 3D object workflow requires all necessary data to be managed locally (as a multipatch feature class) and published as a web layer for visualization. While this method works well for static 3D content that doesn\u2019t need frequent updates, it lacks flexibility; any data changes require the layer to be republished. In June 2023, Esri introduced the 3D object layer. You can now: Host your 3D models in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. Edit (add, update, delete) these 3D features directly on the web using Scene Viewer or custom web apps built with ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. As a result, ArcGIS can function as a \u201csystem of record\u201d for geolocated 3D objects such as buildings, building parts, street furniture, bridges, or underground structures. You can upload models in various formats. Upon upload, your models are securely stored in the 3D object layer without loss and are accurately geolocated. Once you store a 3D model, you can easily update its position, orientation, scale, and other custom attributes without altering the source files. This blog post aims to provide you with all the basics to get you started. Below is a preview of the key areas we will be delving into: The value of 3D object layers | Publishing | Sharing | Editing | Caching | Best practices The value of 3D object layers We believe there is significant potential for new applications across various industries: Architects, engineers, and urban planners can now georeference and evaluate their designs directly within a 3D context, leveraging the new 3D basemaps. Government agencies can further streamline and digitize the electronic submission process for building and planning documentation. They can also provide public access to downloadable 3D assets, enabling faster and more efficient workflows for their users. Archaeologists can create and update 3D models of excavation sites, preserving detailed records of their findings. Alternatively, historical sites can be virtually reconstructed, enhancing our understanding of civilizations and enriching educational practices. Implementation overview The capabilities of the 3D object layer are achieved by integrating a 3D object scene layer with a 3D object feature layer. The scene layer enables efficient display, while the associated feature layer serves as a database, enabling ad-hoc editing and querying. There may be a temporary performance impact during the editing process, as edited features are drawn from the feature layer rather than the optimized scene layer cache. The extent of this impact on your workflow will depend on the number and complexity of the edits. However, once editing is complete\u2014or at regular intervals\u2014you can rebuild your 3D object layer through a process known as caching, restoring it to its full efficiency. Publishing a 3D object layer Now that we have some background, let\u2019s explore how to create and publish a 3D object layer. For publishing, you can use either ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro 3.2 or newer versions. ArcGIS Online provides a more streamlined workflow for publishing an empty layer. However, since this feature is newly available, it currently only supports publishing in the geographic coordinate system WGS 1984 spatial reference. Since our example uses a projected coordinate system, we will set up our project and publish our layer using ArcGIS Pro. Setting up your project in ArcGIS Pro Choosing the appropriate spatial reference for a GIS project is crucial. To ensure compatibility of the 3D object layer with your project, you should publish it using the same spatial reference. To visualize your data on the globe, use a Global Scene and make sure your 3D object layer is published using the WGS 1984 coordinate system. To work in a projected coordinate system (PCS) suitable for your geographic area, use a Local Scene. Ensure that your data (including basemaps and layers) and your 3D object layer are published in that PCS. This setup ensures maximum accuracy in georeferencing your 3D content. While Web Mercator is a commonly used PCS for visualizing web GIS content, it introduces significant distortions and scale variations. We do not recommend using it in a local scene (projected) or as a spatial reference for publishing 3D object layers. This blog post uses LV95, the PCS used in Switzerland, as an example. The workflow ensures maximal precision in georeferencing 3D models in Switzerland. All necessary layers, including basemaps, elevation layers, and 3D building objects, are publicly available in LV95, allowing you to follow along. As a next step, you need to publish a 3D object layer that wi",

    "date": "2024-11-20",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 20, 2024 What\u2019s New in Spatial Statistics: Filter Spatial Autocorrelation From Field By Cheng-Chia Huang In ArcGIS Pro 3.4, we released a new tool in the new Spatial Component Utilities (Moran Eigenvectors) toolset \u2013 Filter Spatial Autocorrelation From Field. This tool allows us to take a numeric variable and tease out the spatial patterns from it. It gives us what we call a filtered variable and one or more spatial components. The filtered variable represents the original variable after pulling out identifiable spatial patterns from it. Imagine a scenario depicted in Fig 1, a numeric variable colored in green shows higher values in the southern and southeastern regions. By applying the Filter Spatial Autocorrelation From Field tool, the variable is separated into nonspatial and spatial parts. The non-spatial part, shown in blue, represents a spatially filtered variable. The spatial patterns that have been removed from the original variable are captured in the corresponding spatial components. One component reveals patterns in the southeast and non-southeast areas, while the other highlights non-Midwest and Midwest patterns. These components, each representing a specific scale of spatial autocorrelation, are uncorrelated to each other. This tool becomes very useful in two scenarios. First, it helps us to explore the relationship between two variables while reducing the interference of neighboring influences. Second, it enhances regression and machine learning models by eliminating spatial misspecifications and can make non-spatial models become spatial models. The rest of this blog article will show examples of these two scenarios. Data used in this article Boston Housing data: a famous benchmark dataset from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston. County-level census data in Ohio by ArcGIS Pro Enrich tool. Application 1: Is it correlation or is it Tobler\u2019s First Law? \u201cHow is a researcher to know if variable y and variable x are related to each other in a meaningful way, or if they only appear to be related because \u201ceverything is related to everything else?\u201d (Thayn, 2017) As a geographer or a GIS analyst, we recognize that most phenomena do not exist independently from space. We believe Tobler\u2019s first law of geography \u2013 \u201ceverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d This unique aspect of spatial data often violates the statistical assumption that observations are independent of each other. As such, when assessing the relationship between two variables, discerning whether their relationship is genuine or merely a result of significant spatial autocorrelation becomes difficult. For instance, Fig 2 is a scatter plot showing the relationship between the proportion of old houses and the concentration of nitric oxide in Boston. This chart suggests that there is a positive relationship. As the proportion of older houses increases, the concentration of nitric oxide also rises. However, when observations are influenced by their neighboring data points, determining the strong positive relationship depicted in Fig 2 becomes challenging, as this could be due to the confounding impact of the spatial autocorrelation. If you look at the maps of Old Houses and NO (Fig 3 and Fig 4), you will notice that both variables exhibit strong spatial clustering. This is where the Filter Spatial Autocorrelation From Filed tool comes into play. It helps us to isolate the spatial component from a variable, allowing us to investigate the relationship between two variables independently of the influence of their neighbors. In the tool, I first select the Boston data as the Input Features. Then later, Fig 5 and Fig 6 show the tool dialog used to filter the house age and nitric oxide fields. I have generated two outputs by running this tool twice. One output map is symbolized based on the Filtered AGE, representing the proportion of old houses in Boston without the spatial influence (see Fig 7). The second map illustrates the Filtered Nitric Oxide, showing the concentration of NO after filtering the spatial autocorrelation (refer to Fig 8). The filtering steps can be found in the geoprocessing messages. For example, Fig 9 demonstrates how the spatial autocorrelation present in AGE is removed after four iterations. Initially, the Moran\u2019s I index is 0.3206 with a P-value of 0.001, indicating a significant spatial autocorrelation. After filtering four spatial components from AGE, Moran\u2019s I index decreases, and the P-value increases to 0.99. This change tells us that the spatial autocorrelation is no longer significant. Now, Fig 10 shows the relationship between the two variables after filtering out the impact of space. Comparing Fig 2 with Fig 10, we will find that the strong positive relationship shown in Fig 2 is largely due to shared spatial relationships, but some correlation still remains after filtering out the spatial relationships.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 14, 2024 Introducing the Assess Sensitivity to Attribute Uncertainty tool By Alberto Nieto In This Article Assess Sensitivity to Attribute Uncertainty is a new tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 that helps you evaluate how the results of select Spatial Statistics tools change when the values of the analysis variables are uncertain. The tool has been designed to work with data uncertainty measures such as margins of error in American Community Survey data. These uncertainty measures are often included as fields in ArcGIS Living Atlas of World layers. The tool can analyze the results of Hot Spot Analysis, Cluster-Outlier Analysis, Generalized Linear Regression, and Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran\u2019s I). This is the first in a series of planned tools in the Assessing Sensitivity toolset to address various types of uncertainty. ArcGIS Pro 3.4 has an important new tool: Assess Sensitivity to Attribute Uncertainty. This tool helps you evaluate how analysis results can change when there is uncertainty in the data. To help us wrap our minds around these concepts, let\u2019s consider a map of poverty in the Los Angeles region. The poverty data from the U.S. Census Bureau is hosted in the Living Atlas. It and hundreds of similar layers are important data sources for spatial workflows. Let\u2019s focus on Hot Spot Analysis as an example. The Census Bureau provides an estimate of the poverty in each census tract. It is an estimate because the data are collected using a survey, meaning they don\u2019t ask everyone in the census tract about their income. They ask a sample of the population and use those numbers to estimate the value for the entire tract. This results in some uncertainty in the estimates and is inherent in any survey, not just those conducted by the Census Bureau. Typically, the estimates (sometimes called point estimates) provided by the Census Bureau are treated as if they are 100% accurate. When, in fact, the number could be higher or lower than the point estimate. But how much higher or lower? This is where the margin of error (MOE) comes in. The MOE measures how certain the Census Bureau is of the point estimate. It helps answer the question, \u201cHow much higher or lower is the \u2018true\u2019 value than the point estimate?\u201d The Census Bureau (and the Living Atlas) provide a field for the MOE. Each census tract (or county or state) has a MOE. The point estimate represents the best estimate for the variable, say poverty, in each census tract, and the MOE tells us the potential range in which the true poverty level lies. Note: A margin of error constructed at the 90% confidence level indicates that we are 90% confident the true population value lies within the range defined by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the point estimate. Why does this matter? Margins of error can vary greatly, and so can the analytical results! A best practice is to always report the uncertainty level of the data used in your analysis. But you can go one step further. With the new Assess Sensitivity to Attribute Uncertainty tool, you can use these uncertainty measures to see how the uncertainty impacts your analytical results. Here\u2019s how it works: #1: You must have an analysis result, such as a hot spot analysis. This output feature class is generated when you run the Hot Spot Analysis tool (or other supported tools). #2: You also need a way to represent attribute uncertainty. The margin of error is a common way to do this, but other data providers represent the uncertainty with an upper and lower bound or as a percentage above and below the point estimate. #3: The tool then creates simulated versions of your data (increasing the values sometimes and decreasing them other times.) #4: The tool repeats the original analysis with the simulated data. #5: After several repetitions, the results are collected and summarized. Any location that differs substantially from the original analysis is deemed \u201cunstable.\u201d The Assess Sensitivity tool summarizes the stability of the analysis across all of the simulated datasets as a hatched layer atop the original analysis result. Here\u2019s an example: You can also click a location to see the categories that resulted across simulations. This is most helpful when evaluating the results for an unstable location: In this example, the hot spot location clicked resulted in a \u201cNot Significant\u201d result in 43% of the simulations. As GIS professionals, our work is impactful; critical decisions are made with the maps we create. For this reason, we need to be transparent about any uncertainty in the analysis and move \u201cfrom aversion [to uncertainty] to acceptance to integration\u201d (Wechsler & Li, 2019). The Assess Sensitivity to Attribute Uncertainty tool is the first of a family of tools dedicated to evaluating, understanding, and communicating the sensitivity of our analyses to various forms of uncertainty. Wechsler, S. P., Ban, H., & Li, L. (2019). The pervasive challenge of error and uncertainty in geos",

    "date": "2024-11-13",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 13, 2024 A new class in arcpy.sharing for web scene layers By Jonah Lay With the release of ArcGIS Pro 3.4, we\u2019re introducing SceneLayerSharingDraft, a new class in the arcpy.sharing module that brings a new level of support for sharing web scene layers using Python. This article covers the basics of the SceneLayerSharingDraft class and how it allows you to automate sharing web scene layers with associated web feature layers to ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. As the use of 3D GIS data increases, web scene layers continue to prove invaluable for visualizing large datasets in 3D scenes. Feature-based scene layers\u2014such as point, 3D object, and building scene layers\u2014can have an associated web feature layer, which supports querying, editing, and filtering. These layers offer dynamic statistical insights that you can use for symbology and definition queries. Previously, publishing web scene layers with associated web feature layers was only possible using the ArcGIS Pro user interface. The SceneLayerSharingDraft class allows you to automate the same workflow with Python, streamlining your sharing process and helping you efficiently maintain your 3D web apps. Here\u2019s how it works\u2026 Like other sharing classes such as FeatureSharingDraft and MapImageSharingDraft, the SceneLayerSharingDraft is created using the Map object\u2019s getWebLayerSharingDraft method: To create a sharing draft for a web scene layer, specify the following parameters: server_type\u2014Set HOSTING_SERVER if you want the web scene layer to copy all data; an associated web feature layer is included. Set FEDERATED_SERVER if you want the web scene layer to reference registered data; an associated map image layer and web feature layer are included. service_type\u2014Set SCENE_LAYER. layers_and_tables\u2014Reference the layer in the 3D scene in the project you want to publish using the listMaps function from the ArcGISProject object and the listLayers method on the Map class. The parameter must be a list with a single layer referencing a point, 3D object, or building scene layer. Once the SceneLayerSharingDraft object is configured, you can set service level properties on the web scene layer and associated web layers. For example, you can configure cached attributes and enable texture optimization on the web scene layer. You can also configure editing, synchronization, and querying capabilities on the associated web feature layer. For a complete list of configurable properties, see Properties. Next, you can optionally use the new analyzeForSharing method to analyze the SceneLayerSharingDraft object and review any errors, warnings, and messages. Finally, publish the web scene layer and any associated web layers using the Publish function: You can use the optional item_id parameter to specify item IDs for the web scene layer and associated web layers. The parameter is honored for web scene layers and web feature layers when sharing to ArcGIS Enterprise 10.8.1 or later. For map image layers, the parameter is honored when sharing to ArcGIS Enterprise 11.2 or later. The item_id parameter must be structured as a dictionary: As shown in the example above, the IDs must be available and contain 32 alphanumeric values ranging from the letters a to f and numbers 0 to 9. An item ID will be automatically created if no ID is specified. Once the web scene layer and associated web layers are published to ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise, caching starts on the server. Once caching is successful, you are ready to use the web scene layer in your scene or 3D application. We are excited for you to try out this new arcpy.sharing class.

    "title": "Fill NoData holes in raster data",
    "date": "2024-11-12",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Analytics Nov 12, 2024 Fill NoData holes in raster data By Juan Laguna Rasters can have holes (also called voids, gaps, or NoData) in them. These areas can be large and very visible, or they can be individual or small groups of cells scattered throughout and not easily seen. Suppose you want to eliminate them? How can you fill the NoData holes with meaningful values, while preserving other existing values? There is a variety of ways to do that. Here we will give some background, a few things to consider, and then show four common solutions. What is NoData? A raster is a data structure that records information about a phenomenon, such as category, magnitude, height, or image reflectance, organized into a regular matrix of equally sized cells arranged into rows and columns. However, sometimes there is not enough information available to give a value to a cell, either from the data source or the output from an analytical operation. The concept of NoData is used to represent these cells. When displaying rasters, the renderers allow you to set the NoData cells to appear either with a color of your choosing, or to not display at all (transparent). For analysis, how input NoData cells are handled can vary based on the particular tool that is used. For some tools, those locations will remain NoData in the output. Other tools calculate an output value based on other available values. The reference documentation commonly addresses the NoData behavior for a particular tool. However, the behavior may not be suitable for your analysis. You may want to identify these NoData cells so you can replace them with appropriate cell values. How can you do that? Identify NoData cells There is a tool that explicitly identifies NoData cells, the Is Null tool. It checks each cell and returns a value of 1 if a cell is NoData, and a value of 0 (zero) if a cell is any other value. If the resulting raster has values of both 0 and 1, then the input raster has NoData cells present. In the attribute table of the raster, the Count field tells you how many cells there are of each value. In the following example, the input raster is on the left with the NoData cells rendered in white. This raster has 9 rows of 10 columns, and thus has 90 cells. There are four unique values (3, 9, 15, and 22). Summing up the cell counts of each value (11, 22, 25, and 10, respectively) gives a total of 68 cells. Taking 90 and subtracting 68 from it tells you there are 22 NoData cells in the input. The output from Is Null and its attribute table is shown on the right. The cell value of 1 represents NoData, and it matches the expected count of 22 cells. Factors to consider in the analysis Before starting any analysis, first look closely at the problem you are trying to solve. To make sure you follow the right analytical path to get the appropriate answer, carefully consider the types of analysis you will perform. When it comes to picking the right solution for filling NoData areas, some factors to consider are: Where are the replacement values coming from? Is the raster discrete or continuous? Examples of discrete raster data include those recording land use classes or ranks. Examples of continuous rasters include elevation and concentration. What is the nature of the NoData area to fill? Is it only a few cells scattered throughout, or large blobs that are many cells across? Some solutions will work better on small areas a few cells in size, whereas others can handle larger areas. What do you want to replace NoData cells with? To choose the proper solution, first determine where the replacement values are coming from. Common sources of replacement values include: A) A specific numerical value B) Cell values from another raster C) The nearest cell D) A statistic of the surrounding values, such as the average or the largest Once you decide the source of the replacement values, then you just need to follow a specific workflow. There are of course many types of raster analysis that can be done, and different ways to go about doing it. This article does not cover all the scenarios, but will focus on some of the typical ones. Workflows for replacing NoData The following graphic illustrates these four workflows at a general level. The column on the left lists the scenarios according to where the replacement values will come from. The center column shows the basic workflow to use for each scenario. The rightmost column provides some information on the general applicability of the scenarios, considering the size of the NoData area and the type of data. A: Replace NoData cells with a specific value The easiest way to fill NoData is to replace those cells with a specific value. Since the same value will be used for all instances, it can be applied to all the NoData cells without having to consider their size or distribution. This method is most suited for discrete data. As shown earlier, you can use the Is Null tool to create a raster that uses a value of 1 to i",

    "date": "2024-11-11",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Imagery & Remote Sensing Nov 11, 2024 Map Oaks Using AVIRIS Hyperspectral Imagery By Hong Xu ArcGIS Pro 3.4 introduces several enhancements for hyperspectral imagery, including support for AVIRIS \u00ad\u00ad\u00addata, improved Cloud Raster Format (CRF) storage for hyperspectral data, and a new Add Hyperspectral Data dialog box, which enhances the user experience when working with hyperspectral data. This blog uses the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve as the study area to demonstrate how these improvements have streamlined the analysis workflow, allowing the creation of an oak tree map for the preserve using hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery. Get familiar with the data and the study area Located at the intersection of two ocean currents at Point Conception in Santa Barbara County, the Dangermond Preserve is a home to a variety of wildlife species. Its coastal oaks are remarkable for their ability to thrive near the ocean while providing essential habitats for the area\u2019s wildlife. Our goal is to map the existing oak trees using AVIRIS hyperspectral imagery. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) is a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mission that began providing hyperspectral imagery in 1989 and has recently been innovated with the next-generation AVIRIS-NG. AVIRIS-NG captures imagery across the full wavelength spectrum, and its high-spatial and spectral resolution enables applications that are not possible with traditional multiband images, such as tree species mapping, greenhouse gas detection, and mineral analysis. AVIRIS-NG data can be accessed from the AVIRIS-NG Data Portal. We downloaded eight scenes covering the study area, specifically the surface reflectance product from the year 2020. To examine the data, we load one of the images to ArcGIS Pro using the new Add Hyperspectral Data dialog box in ArcGIS Pro. The image is a long strip along the flightline; the 4-meter resolution clearly reveals the oak trees and the former agriculture land where the preserve has planned to plant new oak trees. The AVIRIS image consists of 425 bands, covering a wavelength range from 380 to 2,510 nanometers. Two prominent spikes in the spectral profile are caused by water vapor absorption in the atmosphere. These \u201cnoisy\u201d bands are not useful in our study and will be removed to improve accuracy in analysis. Create a hyperspectral image mosaic for the study area To prepare data for analysis, we will first create a mosaic dataset from the eight AVIRIS images using the new AVIRIS raster type, which is used to search, identify AVIRIS imagery, and construct rasters for the mosaic dataset. Since the image extent includes many NoData pixels due to the orientation of the long flightline, we used the Build Footprint tool to recalculate the geometry of the footprint, ensuring the scene includes only valid pixels. Because large portions of the images fall outside of the study area and some bands are not relevant to our analysis, the next step is to create a mosaic that includes only the necessary pixels. To do this, we will apply a processing template, shown below, that clips the mosaic to the study boundary and removes the noisy bands using the following processing template. The Subset Bands function, specifically designed for hyperspectral imagery, allows you to extract bands by specifying wavelength or band ID ranges. In this case, we exclude bands in the ranges of 192 to 211 and 285 to 314, which is \u201cnoisy\u201d data due to water vapor absorption. Finally, we use the Generate Raster From Raster Function geoprocessing tool to save the result as a hyperspectral image mosaic in CRF format. The two pikes in the spectral profile at the same location in the mosaicked image have been successfully removed. Perform analysis Now we are ready to begin our analysis. To extract oak trees within the study area, we will use the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method in the Classify Raster Using Spectra tool. Unlike other classification methods, SAM allows us to extract only the class interested (in this case, oak trees) without classifying all other pixels in the image. To start, we first collected a few oak tree locations using the Training Sample Manager. Next we used the Classify Raster Using Spectra tool with the hyperspectral image mosaic and the measured training samples we prepared earlier. The result of the process is the oak tree map of the Dangermond Preserve. To determine the appropriate threshold, we initially set the threshold to zero, output both the classified raster and score raster which contains the spectral angle values to the target, then used the score raster to fine-tune the threshold. The extracted oak trees are represented by pixels with spectral angles closest to the training samples. Most oak trees are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the preserve, with very few found in other areas. The preserve\u2019s coastal live tree restoration project has seeded 5,068 trees since 2020, and we believe these",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Announcements Dec 13, 2024 Topological editing enhancements in ArcGIS Pro By Josphat Mutunga This blog highlights key topological editing improvements in ArcGIS Pro 3.4. These new features apply to both map and geodatabase topologies and allow you to choose how you visualize and interact with topology edges and nodes while editing in the map. As of ArcGIS Pro 3.4, tools that support topological editing include Align Edge, Edit Vertices, Move, and Reshape. When either map or geodatabase topology is turned on, the Edges tab appears on these tools, allowing you to make feature and topological edits. You can visit Topology in ArcGIS and Create a topology for in-depth general information about topology and how to set it up in the geodatabase. Topology options on the Editor Settings dialog box A new Topology tab that hosts existing and new topology settings was added on the Editor Settings dialog box. This dialog box can be accessed from the Settings button on the Edit ribbon tab or from the Topology combo box drop-down menu. The Display settings persist across projects once they\u2019re set but defaults can be restored using the Reset Page button. Map Topology settings have their own dialog box in earlier ArcGIS Pro releases, but at 3.4, they are hosted here. Only highlight topology nodes and edges when hovered over or selected To get this behavior, set the Display Style option to Selected Elements. When you open a topological editing tool such as Reshape Edge, the topology graph builds but its highlighting color only displays when you hover over or select an edge or node; otherwise, all other features maintain their layer symbology. In the image below, a Park Roads edge is selected, but you can still distinguish Park Trails and Park Boundary features in the map by their symbology. In contrast, the following image shows the same area in the map In ArcGIS Pro 3.3 when a topological editing tool such as Reshape Edge is active; all topological nodes and edges are highlighted with a magenta color. The selected edge is shown with a thicker symbol. Note that you can still maintain this current offering if the Display Style is set to All Elements. Nodes are now displayed prominently When a topological editing tool is active, nodes can now be more easily identified on the map. This feature is available when the Selected Elements option is selected. A node indicates where two or more edges intersect, and this information can be useful when performing data quality and maintenance tasks. Change the color and thickness of the overlay topology graph You are no longer restricted to using the built-in magenta color option of the topology graph. You can now select a different color using the ArcGIS Colors palette, which also expands this capability to advanced hue options and transparency setting. Additionally, you can change the thickness of the topology graph highlighting by changing the Scale from a range of 50% \u2013 200%. Note that Color and Scale settings apply to both All Elements and Selected Elements display styles. Bonus enhancement: Control editability at layer node level in the Selection tree view In versions earlier than ArcGIS Pro 3.4, you could uncheck the box next to an individual selected feature in the Selection tree view to temporarily disable editing on that feature. This meant that you needed to uncheck every feature and/or control layer editability on the List by Editing tab in the Contents pane to prevent certain layers from being edited using any of the topological editing tools. This is the recommended method to prevent layers from participating in map topology. You can now disable a layer to make all its selected features not editable by unchecking a box next to the layer node in the Selection tree view. Conclusion The ArcGIS Pro Editing team will continue to collect your feedback about topological editing to make the experience better. You are encouraged to use the comments section to add any other improvements you want to see. In conclusion, the new topology settings allow you to change display styles, color, and scale of the topology graph. The benefits of these enhancements include, but are not limited to, the following: Display the entire topology graph or selected edges and nodes. Nodes are enlarged when displayed on the map. Options to adjust Color and Scale of the topology graph. Remove layers from an edit operation in the topological editing tool\u2019s Selection tree view.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Nov 07, 2024 Color Theorem Maps By Chris Wesson We have created a new tool to help you color map polygons while ensuring that any two adjacent polygons will not have the same color. You will have likely made or come across maps like the one above: Political maps in atlases or World wall maps. Or perhaps you have created your own maps of administrative regions, states, counties, plot boundaries, or other polygonal reference maps. These are all applications where the subject is the polygons themselves. There is no thematic field or choropleth value to color by but instead the creator wants to add a fill to make it easier to see the different shapes and where one ends, and another one begins. Borrowing a quote from Megan Johnson at NCSA, For a world map to be useful, each country must be easily distinguishable from the next. Conversely, if we color in every country differently, it becomes visually overwhelming and similar colors start to look thematic or \u201cof the same group\u201d. Background The idea that a contiguous set of 2-dimensional polygons can be colored with no more than four or five colors (while still ensuring that any two adjacent polygons will not have the same color) has been around since the 1800s but a series of claim and counterclaim as to its proof continued right through to 2005. Since then, we have had various developer samples and solutions both from Esri and from our users in the various GIS ecosystems over the past twenty years, but generally most cartographers have chosen to color these in map form manually. While there is still a case for cartographers manually improving certain decisions, driven by many customer requests, we were keen to produce a tool to automate as much of the process as possible. Welcome the \u2019Calculate Color Theorem Field\u2019 tool! Most solutions until now insisted that data must be contiguous (have no gaps), have no overlaps, and be comprised of only singlepart features. We know that GIS data and use cases are often not quite that simple! Also, our developers were very keen that none of these should be prohibitive. So, rather than enforce four or even five colors, our tool works out both neighbors and proximity using graph theory and respects and retains multipart polygons. By doing this we keep the number of colors used low but ensure that every neighboring, overlapping or very near feature has a different color to the one next to it. Rather than dictate colors, we provide an integer field that you can use with the Unique Values renderer to effectively \u201ccolor by number\u201d with a palette of your own choosing. Some data providers already provide color index fields with their datasets in a similar fashion. Using the tool Search for the tool or find it in the Cartographic Refinement toolbox (Cartography Tools) Select the input features you wish to color and the name of the field (existing or new) that will contain the new values Run the tool and it will populate the chosen field with an integer value, e.g. 1 through 5 Now, open the Symbology options, and choose to style by Unique Values. Choose the updated integer field and a suitable color scheme. That\u2019s it! Pro tip: If the resulting field has many unique values, there is a high chance that this is caused by a lot of overlaps in your data or by duplicate geometries. You may want to consider some data cleansing before running the tool again. Multipart polygons To ensure certain polygons are assigned the same color value, for example a mainland extent with a chain of islands under the same sovereign rule, or a country and its enclaves, then make them a multipart feature and the tool will treat them as one. A side note on the Number of colors We have tried to use as few colors as possible and to use them evenly. However, under some circumstances our tool does not use the absolute minimum number of colors. This is usually when the data is non-contiguous, overlapping or multipart: Solutions that enforce minimum colors often won\u2019t run on such scenarios. If you wish to reduce the number of colors, it is possible to edit the field for manual fine-tuning after running the tool; or run the tool several times on different geographic extents. To set the processing extent, go to the Analysis ribbon and under Geoprocessing choose Environments. That\u2019s all folks! In case you were wondering, I created the map at the top \u2013 full version here \u2013 simply by running our tool on Natural Earth data, applying colors, and pasting it into my own customized version of the Equal Earth map: A wonderful resource created by Tom Patterson and our very own Bojan \u0160avri\u010d.

    "date": "2024-11-04",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Data Management Nov 04, 2024 Manage replicas in ArcGIS By Gary MacDougall and Diana Muresan Replication is a widely used method for distributing data, whether it\u2019s from a regional office to local offices through geodatabase replication or for performing field edits while offline using feature service replicas. In both scenarios, managing the replicas associated with your geodatabase data is essential. This blog provides tips on managing replicas using the Manage Replicas tab in ArcGIS Pro, a Python script to list all replicas in a geodatabase, and feature service REST API commands for situations which you don\u2019t have access to the underlying geodatabase. Quick review Geodatabase replication is a data distribution method in which data is distributed across two or more geodatabases creating a replica of part of a dataset or an entire dataset. There are three types of geodatabase replication: checkout/check-in, one-way, and two-way. For example, you can use geodatabase replication to distribute your centralized data to different subdivisions based on different projects. Note: To learn more about this capability, see the Data distribution workflows tutorial series, which describes each replication type using a real-world example. Taking a map offline with feature service sync, allows you to take feature layers offline and stored in a local copy of the data. This allows you to make edits and complete your work without being connected to the network. Once network availability is restored, you can synchronize your local edits. This workflow is particularly useful for field data collection using a mobile device. During this process a replica is created and maintained by the feature service. Note: To learn more about this capability, see the Take branch versioned data offline with feature service sync capability and Take nonversioned data offline blog, which describes this workflow using a real-world example. Now, let\u2019s go over some of the ways to manage geodatabase and feature service replicas. The Manage Replicas pane In ArcGIS Pro you can use the Manage Replicas tab. The pane can be accessed from the geodatabase level, where you see all the replicas associated with that geodatabase or at the feature class level, which filters the replicas to be displayed only for that specific feature class. This is even more beneficial to identify if a feature class or table is part of any replicas. The Manage Replicas pane displays the geodatabase and the feature services replicas in two categories. In the Manage Replicas pane you can do the following: Filter replicas using the search bar based on the feature name, replica owner, replica name, ID, and so on. You can also search based on the feature service name to display all the replicas associated with a particular feature service. View replica properties, which allows you to refresh the replica, and unregister, or check the replica details. Use the Add replica to map option to add the feature classes of that replica to the map. Validate the schema option to check for any schema changes between the replica and the source datasets. Unregister a replica This is especially helpful with unregistering a replica if it is no longer needed, or if the associated feature service has been deleted and the replica is now orphaned. Replicas report The Manage Replicas tab allows you to manually interact and manage the replicas from ArcGIS Pro using a database connection. You can also automatically list all the replicas in an enterprise geodatabase, using a Python sample script. The sample script uses the ListReplicas function to list all the replicas in a geodatabase by specifying the path to the database connection file as the argument. The script iterates through the replicas and prints the replica details in the Output console. The response contains the replica details, such as the replica ID, the sync direction, and the service name for feature services replicas. This is similar to what you would find in the Manage Replicas pane. To make it easier to read, copy the response from the Output console into an empty text editor (for example, Notepad), and save the file as a .csv file. Once you open the .csv file, you can view all replicas details and manage the replicas based on the details listed. For example, you can find out if a replica has not been synchronized for a long period of time based on the lastSyncDate, lastSend or lastReceive dates. From this you may determine that the replica should be removed as is not in use any longer. To remove the replica, you can copy the replica ID from the report, and use it with the Unregister Replica geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro. The Unregister Replica geoprocessing tool is supported for both geodatabase replicas and replicas generated by the feature service. Feature service REST API If you want to manage feature service replicas but don\u2019t have access to the geodatabase connection, you can use the feature service REST endpoint. This ",

    "date": "2024-10-31",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Mapping Oct 31, 2024 Mapping the Devil's Real Estate Portfolio By Valeria Chavez Earlier this fall, as part of my birthday weekend celebration, I dragged a group of friends (and our dogs) to Duffield, Virginia to hike to the Devil\u2019s Bathtub. While the hike wasn\u2019t particularly challenging, the actual bathtub was a spectacular natural feature. It truly did seem like someone in desperate need of a relaxing bath had carved it out of the ground \u2013 and that someone could very well have been the Devil for all we knew. By the time I got back home and recovered internet access, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how many other amazing spots like the one we had just seen were out there. A cursory search confirmed that this \u201cbathtub\u201d wasn\u2019t an outlier; geographic oddities like this one are commonly attributed as belonging to the Devil. We often hear about location, location, location when it comes to investing in real estate. But what about the gorgeous spots in the middle of nowhere? The ones that are hard to believe exist without some form of human or supernatural intervention? And so, with that in mind, I set out to map the Devil\u2019s real estate portfolio. Collecting Data Points To perhaps nobody\u2019s surprise, I couldn\u2019t find an existing dataset with the locations of all places called \u201cDevil\u2019s ______\u201d so instead I set out to build my own. A query in the USGS\u2019s Geographic Names Information System returned 1356 locations and while I would have loved to map all of them, I opted for what I\u2019ll call my top 50 spots. The list grew organically from places I had heard about in the past from friends or places that otherwise caught my eye while doing research for this map. I tried to group them into themes as much as I could but inevitably ended up with an \u201cothers\u201d category. Calculate Color Theorem Field As I started envisioning my Layout, it quickly became apparent that I would need a way for the viewer to connect the legend item to the map itself. I was hesitant to use a different color for each of the 50 points or, for that matter, the 48 states of the continental U.S. Instead, I opted to use the Calculate Color Theorem Field tool. This is a new tool in the Cartographic Refinement toolset available with ArcGIS Pro 3.4 which populates a field that can be used to symbolize polygons so that no two adjacent polygons are the same color using a small number of colors. The tool asks for only 2-parameters: Input Features and Field Name (which can be an existing field or a new one to be created). We can then use this field to inform our Unique Values primary symbology. As I built my legend, I went on to match the color of the marker to the color of the corresponding state (i.e. maroon for #2 and Arkansas, purple for #4 and Arizona, etc). This makes it easier to identify where the point is located as it narrows down what the viewer is looking for to only 5 colors. Spooky Color Scheme One of the first things I like to do when I\u2019m working on a new map is define my color scheme. I wanted to give this map a Halloweeny feel without falling into the traditional black and orange we see everywhere. That being said, I did start with a pumpkin orange tone (# EB6123) and went up to a maroon (# AE4832) and down to a lighter tangerine (# EF7E1E). I wanted the remaining two colors to pop and so I went for a bright green (# A8A800) and purple (#534696) that reminded me of a witch costume I wore as a kid one year. Once I had chosen my colors, I used the Color Scheme Editor to look at the different ways my map would look depending on what color corresponded to each Color Theorem Field value. The Color Scheme Editor allows you to easily shuffle around the different blocks in a discrete color scheme. Once you\u2019re done changing things up, you can save your color scheme to a style. This allows you to easily share the color scheme and/or reuse it in another map. Final Map This is what the map ended up looking like. For my text, I paired Juice ITC (serif) with Poiret One (sans serif). I tend to use serif fonts for titles and labels \u2013 anything that I want to have a bit of a fancier look \u2013 and sans serif fonts for descriptions as they\u2019re a bit easier to read. I felt these two fonts paired well together as Juice ITC is long and thin, while Poiret One is shorter and wider. I decorated the layout with some simple illustrations I made in Adobe Illustrator to fill in some of the empty space. I kept them mainly made up of white lines but used the same colors as in my map and legend for color accents. My Top 3 Favorite Spots While doing research for this map, I got to learn about some awesome spots around the continental US and the folklore that give them their names. Here are my top 3 favorite ones: Devil\u2019s Hole (NV) Detached unit of Death Valley National Park, home to the only naturally occurring population of Devils Hole pupfish (cyprinodon diabolis).

In this blog we\u2019ve addressed those topics. Whether you are watching for the first time, or want to refresh your memory you can access the webinar recording below: Answering the questions\u2026 We have grouped the questions into the following categories: Choosing the field app that works best for you Offline data capture and submission Improving accuracy with external devices Working with QuickCapture templates Information on webhooks Choosing the field app that works best for you When collecting data in the field, it is important to use the correct tool to improve efficiency and maintain accuracy. Esri understands that not every field data collection workflow is the same, they each come with different requirements and different end user needs. Esri provides multiple mobile apps for field data collection, each with distinct features, strengths and user experiences. It is up to the end user to decide what is most important for their field data workflow and choose the appropriate mobile app. Here is a high-level overview of the capabilities that set these apps apart: ArcGIS Field Maps is a data-driven mobile map app built for field teams. With Field Maps you can collect and edit both spatial and form-based data and find assets and information while in the field. A flexible, streamlined deployment environment ensures workflows can be iterated easily. ArcGIS Survey123 is a form-centric mobile app. These smart forms drive the user experience in Survey123, making it ideal for data collection workflows that traditionally have involved forms. With Survey123 you can model anything from the simplest to the most sophisticated forms and collect data from mobile, web and desktop devices. ArcGIS QuickCapture is a simple-to-use app that allows rapid data collection with minimal user involvement through a \u2018big button\u2019 interface. Users can easily tap a button to collect new data while traveling at-speed\u2013 on foot, from a vehicle, boat, or aircraft \u2013 or while otherwise unable to use more interactive interfaces. All three mobile data collection apps can do the following: Work with ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise Work while connected or disconnected Share the user\u2019s location using the location sharing capability Offline data capture and submission QuickCapture supports offline workflows hosted both in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. Once a user downloads the QuickCapture project to their mobile device, the user can collect data regardless of whether they have a data connection. A few considerations for QuickCapture project authors: Data submission: When the device is online, captured records are sent automatically if Autosend is enabled. If the device is offline, the app can be configured so captured records are automatically sent the next time the device is online. Maps: By default, QuickCapture will cache any online web maps when the device is offline. The extent viewed while online will remain visible offline. Authors can also select an offline map (.tpk, .vtpk, or .mmpk) that will always be available when the device is offline. If the QuickCapture project is opened while offline, and no offline map has been configured by the project author, the Esri default offline map will be visible. Learn more in the ArcGIS QuickCapture Configure Project Map documentation. Location data: By default, QuickCapture uses the location reported by your device\u2019s internal location provider, unless it has been configured to use an external GNSS receiver. If no location is available, QuickCapture will provide an alert that the location is not available. Improving accuracy with external devices Using an external GPS is a great way to improve the accuracy of field-collected data. ArcGIS QuickCapture supports direct connections to a GNSS receiver via Bluetooth, network, or USB (Windows only). Indirect connections through a GNSS vendor application are also supported, usually used in scenarios with RTK or other corrections being applied. Additionally, you can store GNSS metadata to fields when geometry is captured. The standardized metadata fields are recognized automatically by QuickCapture Designer. Learn more about using high accuracy GNSS receivers with QuickCapture Working with QuickCapture templates ArcGIS QuickCapture offers a variety of industry-specific templates to expedite the creation of QuickCapture projects. These templates come equipped with a feature layer containing relevant industry fields and symbology, a QuickCapture project, and in some instances, preconfigured web maps and dashboards. Moreover, admins have the option to make their own QuickCapture projects avai",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Local Government Nov 22, 2024 Enhanced Damage Assessment Solution Improves Collaboration By Jeremiah Lindemann and Walter Potts Note: In November 2024, this solution was updated to align to FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance 4.0.5 forms version and Public Assistance forms version 4.0.6, along with several other minor enhancements. The number of natural disasters and the cost of the recovery have been increasing everywhere. Assessing damage in a timely fashion helps local officials understand the severity and magnitude of the incident and its effect on public and private property. Information collected during these assessments is analyzed to determine if the incident-related costs and damages qualify for any state or federal assistance. Any delays could make an organization ineligible for state or federal assistance. The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has two programs that provide assistance when a natural disaster or catastrophic event occurs. These programs supplement state, local and tribal government efforts to provide emergency services that lessen the impact of a disaster. Although many incidents don\u2019t result in a state or federal emergency declaration, some degree of assistance is still required. On June 30, 2021, a new version of the Damage Assessment solution was released. This new and improved solution aligns with FEMA programs and includes a comprehensive set of capabilities that help collect damage reports, assign initial damage assessments, monitor the impact of a disaster on the community, brief internal stakeholders, and share information with the public. The new Damage Assessment solution can be used for declared or non-declared emergencies to quickly understand the impact of a disaster and start the recovery process. Understand community impact During an emergency, residents need to understand the impact of the incident on their community and how recovery activities may affect them. The Damage Assessment ArcGIS Hub Site can be used by emergency management agencies to share damage assessment information with those that have been impacted. In addition, damage reports can be solicited from the community to better gauge the severity of the damage. Manage damage reports As public damage reports are submitted, the Damage Assessment Operations app can be used by emergency management staff to manage, monitor and administer damage assessments. The information submitted can then act as a starting point for initial damage assessments conducted by government officials. Conduct damage assessments An internal ArcGIS Hub page provides damage assessment resources to public safety staff and volunteers so they can quickly assess damage severity. These assessments determine how much help the community needs. The Windshield Damage Report can be used by public safety staff or trained volunteers to rapidly capture damage reports. After windshield and public reports are reviewed and assigned, more detailed Individual Assistance and Public Assistance surveys can be conducted to collect information required by FEMA. Monitor damage assessments When an incident occurs, local governments must ensure Individual Assistance priorities and Public Assistance needs are effectively captured and communicated to state and federal authorities. The Damage Assessment Operations app can be used to monitor the impact as damage assessments are conducted. This information is used to determine if a state or national emergency declaration threshold has been exceeded. Administer damage assessments Damage information is a valuable resource used by many agencies and collaboration with other agencies is critical in making informed decisions. To support collaboration and data sharing, the Damage Assessment solution includes a series of tools that helps manage incident information, provision field users, share information with partner agencies, and export or report incident data. These tools can be accessed from the Damage Assessment Operations app and used throughout an incident. Additional resources Learn more about the Damage Assessment solution and how you can quickly deploy this solution on the ArcGIS Solution site. For questions and feedback, chat with us on Esri Community or contact Esri Support Services. Note that the June 2021 release also includes a new Emergency Debris Management solution. It complements the Damage Assessment solution and helps expedite initial debris clearance, assess volume, and monitor the removal of disaster debris accumulated on roads, right-of-ways, and public facilities. Finally, if you work in an electric utility or communications organization and need to respond to outages caused by severe weather conditions and emergency incidents, check out the new Outage Damage Assessment solution. It helps you collect damage reports, manage field assignments, and monitor the impact of a severe weather, or emergency incident, on electric utility and communication assets. Share this articl",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Defense and Intelligence Nov 21, 2024 Just landed: the HLZ Suitability solution By Rachel Mitcavish ArcGIS Solutions helps you make the most of your GIS by providing purpose-driven, industry-specific configurations of ArcGIS. Rotary aircraft\u2014helicopters to the layperson\u2014are agile forms of transportation, well-known for their ability to maneuver with precision in a three-dimensional space. In fact, their agility is precisely why they are deployed by both the military and emergency services when a quick response is crucial, such as to evacuate casualties, offer wildfire support, provide humanitarian assistance, or support military offensive operations. Of course, these critical deployments are frequently to isolated areas, far from established heliports or airfields. Therefore, to reach maximum efficiency, helicopters must be able to land at and take off from a range of environments, which means that geospatial staff must be able to quickly identify safe and effective helicopter landing zones (HLZ). This November, ArcGIS Solutions released HLZ Suitability, a solution designed to help defense and emergency management organizations identify and understand these locations. Included with ArcGIS, this solution can be deployed to your ArcGIS Online account or ArcGIS Enterprise portal and then downloaded for use in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS AllSource. Improving operational planning Your organization\u2019s geospatial team can use the solution\u2019s ArcGIS Pro project to identify and assess terrain suitable for helicopter landing zones (HLZ) per operational standards, create HLZ candidate locations, and share HLZ map products with staff. Assess terrain for HLZ suitability Three primary factors impact the suitability of terrain for HLZs: land cover, ground slope, and obstacles. The solution guides you through assessing each of these factors. Not all land cover is suitable for an HLZ; forests, urban areas, and waterbodies are problematic at best and more likely prohibitive. Additionally, helicopters have ground slope limits, with the maximum degree varying slightly depending on the aircraft. Using preconfigured raster functions, you can reclassify land cover and elevation datasets to areas that are acceptable, acceptable with caution, or unacceptable. These raster functions account for a variety of different data sources and operational standards, such as military doctrine and wildfire response standards, but you can also use your own data schema or define your acceptability criteria. Although it\u2019s possible for land cover and ground slope to be classified as acceptable with caution, obstacles such as cell towers, agricultural equipment, and energy infrastructure are more prohibitive. The solution\u2019s ArcGIS Pro project allows you to identify these features using data from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, by loading other obstacle datasets, or by digitizing your own obstacle features. Then, you can create obstacle offset buffers at either the standard 10:1 offset ratio or your own custom offset ratio. These buffers will help clearly identify areas where obstacles pose a risk to helicopter operations and should therefore be avoided. After you have assessed land cover and ground slope and generated obstacle buffers, you can create an overall HLZ suitability raster layer that depicts areas that are acceptable, acceptable with risk, or that include obstacle interference. This raster layer provides a great overview of these conditions, but the solution can take your review even further by allowing you to remove locations that do not meet the minimum military and wildfire aircraft area requirements from the overlay. Additionally, the solution can generate a reference tessellation grid to help you visually review and assess if areas meet your aircraft requirements. You can also upload imagery and soil data to help you visually inspect and review if locations are acceptable for HLZs. Create candidate locations Rotary aircraft vary significantly in size, speed, and maneuverability, so a minimally viable HLZ is not one size fits all. For example, in military operations, a CH-47 Chinook helicopter requires a minimum landing zone diameter of 80 meters, but a Type 3 wildfire response helicopter only requires a 23-meter one. The solution\u2019s ArcGIS Pro project accounts for these differences by including various aircraft types in its feature editing templates and reference tables. After assessing terrain suitability, you can create candidate HLZ locations specific to your organization\u2019s aircraft and operational requirements. Disseminate HLZ map products Once you\u2019ve completed your analysis and have identified HLZs suitable for your organization\u2019s aircraft, you have several options for sharing the information directly from ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS AllSource with operations staff members or leadership. For example, you can publish and share services through your ArcGIS Online organization or ArcGIS Enterprise portal. These services can th",

Here\u2019s what\u2019s new: Capital Project Coordination Robust infrastructure is vital for economic growth and quality of life, leading state and local governments to create capital improvement plans that detail the location, timing, and financing of capital projects. The Capital Project Coordination solution can be used to define and coordinate capital projects, track performance, and communicate investments to stakeholders, aligning public infrastructure projects with private utility investments. Environmental Review Environmental reviews evaluate a project\u2019s potential impact on ecologically sensitive areas and ensure compliance with environmental standards. The Environmental Review solution can be used to facilitate environmental review applications, gather feedback during the review, and share project information with internal and external stakeholders. Grant Tracker Grants provide essential financial support for a wide range of public services and effective grant administration maximizes these financial resources, supports compliance, and ultimately ensures grants are achieving the goals set forth by an organization. The Grant Tracker solution can be used to develop an authoritative inventory of grants, track grants through key phases, evaluate their effectiveness, and inform internal and external stakeholders. HLZ Suitability Rotary aviation is frequently used during military, humanitarian, and emergency situations to evacuate individuals, deliver aid, respond to wildfires, and conduct military offensives. The HLZ Suitability solution can be used to identify and understand suitable locations for expedient helicopter landing zones. Map Notes Map notes are a common way for people to capture information and show where map data may be incorrect or identify an issue that needs to be addressed. The Map Notes solution can be used to capture map notes, triage each note to determine if action is necessary, and share this institutionalize knowledge with stakeholders so it can be easily accessed in future. Mowing Operations Road and parks agencies typically draft mowing plans and service level agreements to maintain parks, open space, and roadsides that improve the overall appearance of a community. The Mowing Operations solution can be used to develop seasonal mowing plans, manage a central repository of mowers, and monitor real-time mowing activity and service performance. Renewables Land Acquisition Renewables companies often rely on spatial data to acquire large tracts of land for the development of new utility-scale renewable sites.

The same applies to stories created with ArcGIS StoryMaps: The little things do matter, and minor details can have a significant impact on the overall quality and professionalism of your work. Here are some steps you can take before publishing and sharing your story to ensure it shines on every platform. Table of contents Proofread your story Test links Review distribution of text and media Ensure content is accessible Provide attribution Review visual language for consistency Remove unused map layers Configure pop-ups and legends Disable enlargement for small images Preview your story on mobile Add item details for improved sharing and SEO Preview your story while signed out 1. Proofread your story This suggestion may seem obvious, but it\u2019s possibly the most important entry in the entire list, as typos and other spelling or grammatical mistakes can undermine the credibility of your story. And after all the work you\u2019ve put into your story, from the copy to the imagery and maps, you might have overlooked something \u2014 we\u2019ve all done it at some point or another. Proofreading your own story is a good start, but we also suggest that you ask someone else to review your story, too \u2014 preferably someone who can serve as a stand-in for your target audience (such as a colleague). This external review can help identify inconsistencies and mistakes that you might otherwise miss. Back to top \u2191 2. Test links You may have added links or buttons to your story. Be sure to test all these links before you publish your story to ensure that your readers are directed to the correct pages. The Open in a new tab option (enabled by default) allows readers to explore external resources without losing their place in your story. But if you\u2019re linking to a section within your story \u2014 or if accessibility is a top priority \u2014 you may want to disable this option. Related reading: Add another dimension to your stories with heading links Back to top \u2191 3. Review the distribution of text and media Establishing a healthy balance between text and visual media can transform your story from an unclear, overwhelming narrative into something more digestible. Instead of presenting loads of text and then a ton of media right after the other, try to create a balance between content types. This will help to maintain your audience\u2019s attention through the entire story. If your story is relatively long, consider enabling the navigation bar so that readers can navigate between different sections more easily. Related reading: Nine steps to great storytelling Back to top \u2191 4. Ensure your content is accessible Ensuring accessibility is not just an authoring best practice, but in some cases, a legal requirement. Adding alternative text to visual media is vital for making your stories accessible to everyone, including members of your audience who may use screen readers. Alternative text is especially important for graphics that contain text, which most accessibility tools can\u2019t interpret.

Present interactive maps offline with the ArcGIS StoryMaps Briefings app\u2014available for iOS and Android tablets and Windows tablets and computers. Take your slides with maps on the go using the Briefings app and deliver briefings that demonstrate the rich, meaningful context of your data. What\u2019s New in the Briefings App Exciting updates to the Briefings app include, a new panel for viewing information, legend and pop-ups about the maps or scenes in your slides, an option to update the downloaded version of your briefings, the ability to view the Briefings app in portrait mode, and more. Quick links Display map information within your slides Enhanced view of the map or scene legend and pop-ups Update the downloaded version of your briefings View briefings in portrait mode Sort briefings by the view count Present express maps with an image base layer Navigate through briefing slides using swipe gestures Find an improved briefing header Display map information within your slides Discover a more intuitive and streamlined experience when displaying information about a web map or a mobile map package (.mmpk) created in ArcGIS Pro as the offline version of the map in your briefing slides. With this update, you will now find an information button added to the top right corner of every web map or mobile map package in your briefing slides. Selecting it will open a panel to the right with information about the map item displayed across three tabs: The Overview tab includes the item information set in your ArcGIS Enterprise portal or in ArcGIS Online, including the title, summary, and description of the web map or information set in ArcGIS Pro while creating a mobile map package. The Bookmarks tab allows you to display any bookmarks added to the web map in Map Viewer in ArcGIS Enterprise or ArcGIS Online or in the mobile map package in ArcGIS Pro. The Gridlines and units tab helps you identify precise locations within the map, making it possible to conduct on-the-go geospatial data analysis. The gridline type and map unit of your choice will apply to that web map or mobile map package when you select it from the list. Enhanced view of the map or scene legend and pop-ups If a legend has been configured for any map or scene that you add to your briefing slides, a legend icon will display on the bottom left. When selected, a panel will show legend on the right. If you enable pop-ups for a web map layer in Map Viewer or web scene layer in Scene Viewer in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise, or enable pop-ups for a layer in a mobile map or scene package in ArcGIS Pro, the pop-up information will display in the panel on the right. As part of this effort, we enhanced the display of pop-ups so that you can now view different content types, including text, fields, and attachments at once, on the same panel. This is also applicable when maps are added in a Swipe block. Please note that if a map or scene or swipe block is added to a briefing slide with a double layout, selecting the information, legend, or search buttons will prompt you to \u201cExpand to access this feature\u201d to view the panel. You can still pan and zoom in or out of your map in the slide view. Update the downloaded version of your briefings To help you keep your downloaded briefings up to date, an update icon will now appear for thedownloaded when it\u2019s connected to the internet. The icon will display for the downloaded briefing when updates are made to the briefing in the ArcGIS StoryMaps builder alerting you that an updated version of the briefing is available for download for offline use. This ensures that you are made aware if the downloaded version you currently have is not the most recent. You can update the downloaded version of the briefing from gallery page or in the briefing header while viewing your briefing slides. Once the update is complete, a message will display that the briefing is up-to-date. View your briefings in portrait mode In addition to sharing your slides in landscape orientation, you can now open the Briefings app and view all your briefings in portrait mode. If your device recognizes auto-rotate, and you switch it from landscape to portrait orientation, the app will auto-adjust all of content to match the orientation of your display. Sort briefings by the view count The view count for each briefing is now displayed on the gallery card in the All Briefings, My Favorites, and My Downloads tabs on the app. With this update you can also choose to sort your briefings based on the view count, which will show briefings in order of the highest to lowest count of views. Please note, that the view count is displayed for online use only. Present express maps with an image base layer You can view and share slides with expr",

    "title": "Mapping with extent or scale in ArcGIS StoryMaps",
    "date": "2024-11-19",
    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Constituent Engagement Nov 19, 2024 Mapping with extent or scale in ArcGIS StoryMaps By Warren Davison and Cooper Thomas Maps are a central component of visual storytelling in ArcGIS StoryMaps. Whether they\u2019re part of a choreographed sequence or offering up datasets ripe for exploration, maps bring spatial narratives to life, so it\u2019s essential that the author has a say in how these maps appear in their story. With the November 2024 release of ArcGIS StoryMaps, maps are about to take your stories to new \u201cextents\u201d \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2014 or should we say scales? This release features mapping enhancements that let authors choose whether a map, specifically web maps and express maps, will preserve its extent \u2014 the area in view, or scale \u2014 the map zoom level, when displayed in the story. This means authors have greater control over how maps appear in different contexts and on various screen sizes. You might even think of these two options as the map equivalents of the \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cfill\u201d options for images. What\u2019s the big deal? So, what\u2019s the difference between preserving extent and scale, and why is it a big deal? Preserving extent ensures that the map\u2019s current view remains visible to readers. This is similar to the \u201cfit\u201d option for images, ensuring that no part of the map is cropped out. Preserving scale keeps the map displayed at its configured zoom level, regardless of placement or screen size, similar to the \u201cfill\u201d option for images. This option is useful when you want readers to experience the map at a specific zoom level. These options give authors more control over map presentation. For example, if your story centers on a road, river, or border, preserving the extent prevents essential parts of the feature from being cropped out. Alternatively, if a map feature is best viewed at a particular zoom level, preserving the scale ensures that readers see it as intended. Extent and scale example Let\u2019s look at an example to illustrate the impact of these two options. Imagine we are authoring a story about earthquake activity in Central America. I\u2019ve created a map of recent earthquakes and saved a bookmark focused on seismic activity off the coast of El Salvador. I\u2019ve also used a rectangular sketch layer to visualize the approximate area of the bookmark. When we add this map to our story and navigate to the bookmark, we see that the bookmark\u2019s extent fits neatly inside our map view. This map will act as our benchmark as we experiment with preserving the extent and scale. These new settings can be found within the map designer\u2019s options panel. Preserving extent Let\u2019s first experiment with configuring this map to preserve the extent of our map. This is the default option and will ensure that everything we see within this map view will be visible to the audience regardless of the map\u2019s placement within the story or the size of the reader\u2019s screen. In this configuration, adjusting the map placement will keep the approximate extent of the bookmark visible while the scale adjusts to compensate for the block size. In the case of our earthquake story, the readers will always have the geographic context of where the earthquake is located within Central America. However, the scale-dependent \u2018shake intensity\u2019 polygon layer might not be visible on some screens or map placements. This configuration may be advantageous when: Ensuring a particular feature is always in view. Ensuring readers always have the surrounding geographic context of the map. Note: When using preserve extent, the block\u2019s aspect ratio might require the map to zoom out to accommodate the desired extent. So, be aware of scale-dependent layers in maps. It\u2019s always a good idea to preview your stories on mobile devices. Preserving scale In comparison, preserving the map scale saves the map\u2019s current zoom level and center point. When selected, the map view will always appear at the configured scale regardless of the dimensions or aspect ratio of the map block. The preserve scale configuration may be advantageous when: Working with scale-dependent layers Displaying individual or isolated features within a map Note: When using preserve scale, data layers within the map view may extend beyond or outside the map\u2019s visible area. It\u2019s always a good idea to preview your stories and ensure they look as intended. Practical implications As an author, these new configurations allow for greater control over how your maps appear in your story. You can tailor their settings to the specific block or layout and focal point of the map. Maps on mobile: The ability to explicitly configure map extent or scale allows authors to better anticipate how their maps will appear on mobile devices. This helps to navigate the unique challenges of screen size and map real estate. By preserving a specific extent or scale, authors can ensure that the map remains visually effective in their story, regardless of the device used. This control allows authors to be more intentional with their layout choices,",
    "summary": "ArcGIS StoryMaps now allows authors to choose whether web maps and express maps preserve their extent (area in view) or scale (zoom level) when displayed in a story. Preserving extent ensures the map's current view remains visible regardless of screen size, similar to a \"fit\" option for images. Preserving scale keeps the map at a specific zoom level, like a \"fill\" option. This gives authors more control over map presentation to prevent key features from being cropped out or to display the map at an ideal scale. The new settings are found in the map designer's options panel.",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Constituent Engagement Nov 01, 2024 A GIS Day success story: Michael Fernandez shares the inspiration behind an image By Ashley Du (she/her/hers) Head on over to @Esrigram, Esri\u2019s Instagram account, made for the mappiest people on earth. Travel the ocean floor, through cityscapes, or back in time through a digital twin. Discover wildfire activity, global biodiversity trends, even PB&J hotspots near you. And behind the dot density, humor, and hashtags, you\u2019ll find the wizard behind the curtain \u2014 Michael Fernandez. Michael is a Social Media Specialist at Esri and oversees content strategy for the corporate Instagram account, better known as @Esrigram. Perhaps more than anyone, Michael understands the power of the right image. For him, it was a superhero map. Five years ago, Michael \u2014 then a youth coordinator at the Boys and Girls Club in Redlands, California \u2014 gathered a captive group of middle schoolers for a GIS Day event. And something unexpected happened. As the hosts unveiled map after map, the teenagers and Michael were wowed by the visuals, the messages behind them, and the fun of geography. And the rest is history. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of GIS Day, Michael shared his journey into the world of GIS, creative approaches to connecting with the Esri community, and the challenges of communicating complex spatial data in an understandable way. The following conversation between Michael and the StoryMaps team has been edited for brevity and clarity. Q. Michael, you may have the most exciting job here at Esri. Can you tell our readers a little bit about what you do? A. Over the past five and a half years at Esri, I\u2019ve held two main positions: Public Relations Coordinator and now Social Media Specialist. My initial work in public relations focused a lot on traditional media and press where I learned about GIS in different industries. Then eventually, our team started to create the foundation for an influencer program, which was innovative and something Esri had never done before. That work, building relationships and trends, offered a natural transition into a social media opportunity. Esri experimented with TikTok for a while, and Esri turned over the strategy and videos to me. It was a really useful pilot as we engaged younger, non-GIS audiences and our traditional users through a non-traditional platform. And when the pilot ended, I had the opportunity to apply those video skills and creativity to @Esrigram. Now, on top of planning, curating, and creating content for @Esrigram, I also help manage social content strategy for all of Esri\u2019s internal publications (ArcNews, Esri Blog, WhereNext, etc.), and handle major announcements across Esri\u2019s corporate social platforms. On the social team and in influence marketing in general, I\u2019ve been fortunate to network and build relationships with so many teams and individuals, like the StoryMaps team. \ud83d\ude0a That\u2019s something that I enjoy. It\u2019s always exciting because everyone brings a different perspective and new ideas to the table. You know, here at Esri, people are creating solutions to some of the world\u2019s biggest problems, and I get to be a part of that. Q. And how did you end up in such a fun and unique role? A. I grew up in the Redlands area, and funny enough, I really knew nothing about Esri until a GIS Day event. In 2018, two Esri employees came to the Boys and Girls Club of Redlands where I was a youth development specialist and also a member growing up. They showcased a few different maps to our middle school students, and there\u2019s one that\u2019s stuck with me over the years \u2014 a Marvel map that laid out the origins of each superhero. The kids loved it because it was something that they were familiar with. It was presented in a way that they could understand, be interested in, but still be intrigued. I was intrigued as well. Again, I had no idea what Esri was. I\u2019d never even heard the name. But after the GIS Day event, the same day, I explored Esri\u2019s website, applied for a public relations position, and the rest is history. Q. So you joined Esri as a public relations coordinator. Did you have any background in geography or GIS? A. No, not all all. I graduated from the University of Laverne with a degree in communications. Q. Was there a learning curve when you started with Esri? What were the challenges? A. Yes, and the learning curve is still present. I don\u2019t let it deter me though. I never did, even when I first joined the company. I didn\u2019t know much about Esri or GIS, but I saw that as a challenge. It was exciting to apply my interests in marketing, communications, and social media to an industry I never thought I\u2019d be involved in. I\u2019ve been here for five and a half years, and there are always new things to learn. I see it as an opportunity to understand better what people are sharing, showcasing, or telling the community At least twice a week, I come across content where I\u2019m like, \u201cI had no idea people could map this.\u201d And it\u2019s absolutely phen",

For accurate analyses, retail businesses need precise information about where people are, when they are there, what other places they tend to go, and how frequently they are in these locations. Additionally, retail businesses also benefit from being able to identify social, behavioral, and economic details that define their target audiences and interests. Esri technology allows us to enrich and analyze mobility data to generate the key information needed for successful retail mobility analytics. For analytics at scale, ArcGIS GeoAnalytics Engine brings together the power of Esri\u2019s spatial analytics capabilities and Spark-based distributed computing to allow for rapid analysis over larger datasets and temporal ranges. Data for movement analytics is often challenging to analyze across large geographic regions and for the range of times necessary to identify the spatiotemporal patterns driving retail mobility. Let\u2019s look at how JAKALA, a Milan-based marketing technology company, works with billions of data points with GeoAnalytics Engine in Databricks to analyze consumer movement data to better understand geographic patterns. This solution also helps JAKALA analyze the retail landscape, target physical or social media advertising campaigns, and improve marketing strategies. Enrich data to create sociodemographic profiles The heart of understanding retail patterns is understanding where people are and what places they are visiting. Every month, JAKALA works with billions of data points from hundreds of thousands of mobile anonymous devices that are sourced from a vendor that gathers opt-in GDPR compliant location tracking data. The spatiotemporal analysis functionality in GeoAnalytics Engine enables JAKALA to combine this high-volume location data with their in-house sociodemographic data (JWhere) to assign anonymous devices to a set of \u201cpersona\u201d profile categories that they have defined. These sociodemographic profiles are key to understanding the broader spatial patterns for the target of interest and provide the foundational data for hyperlocal retail profile and advertising analyses. Identify broad patterns in retail mobility The location data is also analyzed with GeoAnalytics Engine to identify the points of interest (POIs) that have been visited, frequency of visits, and patterns of visitation across the sociodemographic profiles. These details help enhance the understanding of the retail interests and trends specific to a profile and allow JAKALA to evaluate the similarities and differences between different profiles to better understand how to efficiently grow interest in new markets. For instance, if we start with any retail category of interest such as banking, restaurants, automotive, grocery, shopping in general, etc., then data can be aggregated geographically to analyze how visitation has changed over time and see the overall profile of anonymous visitors. Questions can be answered such as who is visiting these sites and what other categories of POIs do they visit? Going beyond looking at general visitation for categories of POIs, the analyses can expand to larger geographic regions of interest to assess gaps or saturation in various markets. For this type of analysis, JAKALA can perform needs assessments over entire regions to identify the categories of services that are underdeveloped and what locations would be suitable for new development in these categories. For instance, for a neighborhood in Rome, JAKALA can assess retail visitation patterns to identify the percentage of visits that come from residents of the neighborhood versus outside the neighborhood. They may ask questions such as what types of POIs do people from outside the neighborhood travel in to visit or what type of POIs do people living in the area of interest look for outside the area? Taking this further, JAKALA can look at the temporal patterns within those visits to understand whether specific days of week or times of day are associated with greatest number of visits to different categories of activity (e.g., shopping, education, healthcare, or restaurant). These analyses allow JAKALA to explore further with gap analysis to present the overall picture of the area to help identify opportunities for new services or infrastructure needed within the area to serve the population. Identify local mobility patterns More local analyses can be done using this data to focus on individual POIs. In order to target advertising and social media campaigns for a particular shop or activity, JAKALA can evaluate profiles for the most common category of visitors. Using spatiotemporal analyses, they can identify when people tend to visit most often such as lunch time or after ",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Real-Time Visualization & Analytics Nov 06, 2024 Visualize Large Amounts of Data with ArcGIS Velocity's Dynamic Aggregation Map Image Layers By Peter Nasuti Real-time data ingestion and analysis workflows span across a variety of industries and often share a common trait \u2014 observational data can build up fast! Whether monitoring a fleet of transit vehicles, the locations of field workers, readings from stationary sensors, critical hazard-event alerts, or other Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time data feeds, the accumulation of data requiring storage is continuously growing. This blog will explore the power of dynamic aggregation available with ArcGIS Velocity, showcasing how to effectively visualize large amounts of data. The Challenge of Managing and Visualizing Real-Time Data Consider a scenario where you are ingesting real-time vehicle location data for a fleet of 50 trucks, each sending its location and relevant attributes every 5 seconds. This results in 10 updates per second, 600 updates per minute, 36,000 updates per hour, and 864,000 updates per day! Managing this amount of ever-growing data is a challenge. Fortunately, ArcGIS Velocity allows users to write data to various outputs, including storage, streaming, or alerting. A common use case involves creating an archive to store historical observations for a specified data period. This can be accommodated with Velocity feature layers backed by the spatiotemporal data store which is included with a Velocity subscription. Continuing our scenario, you are only interested in the previous month of data and the observations are writing to a Velocity feature layer with a one-month data retention period before Velocity moves records over to the feature layer archive. Over one month, this would result in a buildup of 26,784,000 records. When working with a large dataset of 26 million records, presenting this spatial data can be challenging. Opening a web map and zooming to your area of operation requires the mapping application to render 26 million records on the map. This rendering process can take some time and when it completes, you may not be happy with the result. Likely, the map will become overcrowded with many points, making it difficult to understand what you are seeing and analyze spatial distribution patterns. Now consider that not only do you want to see where the vehicles were, but you might also want to understand the average of a per-feature attribute value, such as speed, for those 26 million records. To address these questions and goals, ArcGIS Velocity layers with dynamic aggregation are available and configurable by default and can be used to help your organization. Consider the below image which highlights dynamic aggregation in action. Not only can you view the aggregated features, but when you zoom in past your defined feature threshold, the map client intelligently switches to rendering discrete features. This enables viewers to see the entire picture of their data with dynamic aggregation, while also being able to drill down to individual features for a more detailed understanding. Let\u2019s work through some relevant questions for this workflow: What is dynamic aggregation? Dynamic aggregation is a data visualization technique available for Velocity layers. Instead of viewing individual point, line, or polygon features, you see bins containing your observations. Dynamic aggregation is especially useful when you want to visualize thousands of data points as clusters, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. You can control the shapes, sizes, and colors of these bins. Additionally, each bin can be labeled either with either the count of features contained within that bin, or a statistic that you configure such as minimum, maximum, average, or other user-specified attribute field. How do I enable dynamic aggregation on my layers? To use dynamic aggregation, you must first have data in a Velocity feature layer. This can be created by either a or a real-time or big data analytic. A real-time analytic ingests data through a feed and can write it to a new Feature Layer output. A big data analytic loads stored data from sources, can perform analysis, and can write data to a new Feature Layer output. When configuring a new feature layer output in your Velocity analytic, you will see settings for aggregation styles. You can accept the defaults or use custom configurations for additional styles. In the example below, we added the flat hexagon or triangle aggregation styles to complement the default configurations. For instance, flat hexagons are useful for representing density and patterns in data, while triangles can provide a different perspective on relationships and distributions. How do I adjust dynamic aggregation settings on my Velocity layer? Within the ArcGIS Velocity application, you\u2019ll notice the \u201cOutput: Layers\u201d tab on the green pane on the left side. Select this layers page, and then find or search for your laye",

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Design and Planning Nov 15, 2024 Create KPIs using ArcGIS Experience Builder or ArcGIS Arcade in ArcGIS Dashboards By Tyler Copeland and Josue Aguirre, Nick Karrick and Madhura Phaterpekar With the ArcGIS platform, you\u2019ll never find yourself lacking for an app or method to help visualize progress toward a project\u2019s completion. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measured value that demonstrates progress toward a goal or objective. Planners and analysts use them to understand status, evaluate project feasibility or measure performance toward specified goals. KPIs can be derived by defining equations based on attributes from plan layers, scenarios, and contextual data using mathematical equations. ArcGIS GeoPlanner could display a series of KPIs in a dashboard style as indicators and gauges. As GeoPlanner sunsets, creating KPIs using ArcGIS Experience Builder or ArcGIS Dashboards will provide continuity to project evaluation workflows. This blog article highlights workflows using the following methods: ArcGIS Experience Builder Chart widget Text widget Chart widget Text widget ArcGIS Dashboards The workflows outlined here leverage the feature service from a GeoPlanner project as the input layers defining KPIs. Use Chart and Text widgets in Experience Builder Experience Builder is an option when it comes to visualizing progress of a project. Use the Chart widget The following steps provide guidance around the Chart widget in Experience Builder. 1. Open the Experience Builder app to begin. 2. Create a new experience and add the Map and Edit widgets to the canvas by either using a template containing the widgets or starting with a blank template. 3. In the Map widget settings, choose a web map and confirm it appears in the canvas. 4. In the Edit widget, specify the map you just added. Optionally, add the layer from the map as an editable design layer or use the Import All button. This experience can be used for design purposes and to further populate chart indicators as outlined below. Next, you\u2019ll recreate the gauge style present in GeoPlanner. 5. Add a Section widget to the page and size it similarly to following screenshot: 6. Add a Chart widget on the Section widget and set it to full size so it fills the Section widget. 7. Select the design layer as the data of interest. 8. Choose the Gauge chart type. 9. Choose the statistics type. You\u2019ll sum the values of the Conifer temperate dry field. 10. Customize the other parameters. This example uses a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 100. 11. In the Gauge settings, add a guide. This example uses two guides: one to measure under-performance and another to measure ideal performance. 12. Optionally, shorten the height of the Chart widget so that there is about 15 percent space above it for a title and add a text widget into the space. Modify the font size and weight as necessary. The KPI is complete. 13. Click the settings for the Section widget that contains the Gauge widget, and choose Duplicate to create a copy and compare it to the other designs in the map. 14. In the duplicated Gauge widget, choose an alternative field. 15. Update the duplicated Text widget in the section widget duplicate to reflect that it is a new chart. 16. Lastly, in the settings for the Section widget, enable Arrows to move between the two KPIs. Use the Text widget Complete the following steps using the Text widget in Experience Builder: 1. Repeat the Experience Builder opening steps above to start a layout. 2. Add a Text widget. 3. Sum the values of a single field using the dynamic content capability of the text widget. 4. Connect the widget to the data source that contains your designs or feature template. 5. In the Dynamic content pane, click the Statistics tab. 6. Update the operator to Sum and choose which field to total. 7. Click Insert. The equation appears in the text box and reflects the total value when you click away from it. 8. Next, add text and format it as necessary. This example contains a title and unit of measurement. The font size is updated and the text is a bold format. Create a KPI dashboard using ArcGIS Dashboards and Arcade Complete the following steps to use Arcade in the Dashboards app to visualize progress: 1. Create a new dashboard. 2. Add an element such as a pie chart or gauge. 3. When prompted to select a layer in the element\u2019s settings, specify a design layer. This will be your layer of interest. 4. Optionally, enable advanced formatting with the List, Table, or Indicator elements in their settings. Ensure that the data options have been properly set for advanced formatting to become available. List\u2014Click the List tab, and click the Enable button next to Advanced formatting. Table\u2014Click the Values tab, and click the Enable button next to Advanced formatting.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Defense and Intelligence Nov 14, 2024 Essential Workflow Manager for ArcGIS AllSource By Matt Funk ArcGIS AllSource is an intelligence workstation that blends analysis and production capabilities in one application. But sometimes, especially to new users, it can seem like a disparate set of tools or disconnected commands jumbled into open-ended processes. As with any process, the individual steps that sequence the tools into a cohesive methodology are what makes for a successful result. With ArcGIS Workflow Manager, you can bring standardized processes to your intelligence work creating a sequence of steps for one or more team members to follow. You can develop workflows that require checks and validation steps, build training workflows from senior analysts teaching new analysts and junior analysts, and document and follow infrequently used processes. Workflow Manager components Workflow Manager has two main parts: the Workflow Manager web app that is used to design, manage, and distribute workflows and the Workflow Manager pane in ArcGIS AllSource that is used to discover jobs and follow the steps. The web app and pane work with the following components of Workflow Manager: Workflow items\u2014Workflow items compartmentalize work from groups in your organization and organize sets of workflow diagrams. Workflow items can have different requirements and won\u2019t conflict with items from other groups. Step templates\u2014Step templates are predefined steps that are sequenced together to build a workflow diagram. Each step template contains preconfigured name and default values. There are many step templates to choose from, including Add Attachment, Send Email, and Run Pro GP Tool. Step templates become unique steps when added to a workflow diagram. Workflow diagrams\u2014Workflow diagrams are block flowcharts of business processes and are made by connecting individual steps in sequence, a branch, in parallel, or in a loop depending on the process design. Job templates\u2014Job templates are built from a workflow diagram and contain default properties, such as first assignee or priority or due date, for the job that is created from the template. Job\u2014A job is the individual work process created from the job template. A job might be called a task or work order. It is assigned to a user, several users, or a group and can be scheduled to be completed by a specific date. Many jobs can be created from the same job template, which is recommended for jobs that are repeated often\u2014for example, updating a basemap with new data. The Workflow Manager web app is accessed and licensed through ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise. Users open the web app using the app launcher. In ArcGIS AllSource, users must connect to ArcGIS Online or to a portal and then launch the Workflow Manager pane from the View tab Use Workflow Manager ArcGIS Workflow Manager is the workflow management system on ArcGIS Enterprise and ArcGIS Online that creates the workflow diagrams from business processes and turns them into workable jobs for ArcGIS AllSource users to follow. As an ArcGIS Enterprise user, you create a Workflow Manager workflow diagram to model a process and then add steps from the step library and connect them together. The steps in the library represent actions such as running a geoprocessing service, creating a database replica, defining a location on a map, sending an email, or adding a comment. Once the diagram is finished, you will create a job template from the diagram and assign it to team members. As an administrator in Workflow Manager web app, you will configure workflow diagrams, set up job templates, and administer the workflow items. The following is an overview of the process: Access the Workflow Manager web app. Create workflow diagrams. Create job templates from workflow diagrams. Create jobs from job templates. Run jobs. Manage jobs. Administer Workflow Manager. As a team member, you can use Workflow Manager in ArcGIS AllSource to discover jobs that are assigned to you. Each job is started by the assigned user, and each step is completed or skipped as needed. You complete each step by clicking Proceed, following the instructions, and when finished, marking the step as complete. This will move you to the next step, until the job is complete or moved to the next assigned user in the workflow. The following are the two main steps for ArcGIS AllSource users of Workflow Manager: Connect to Workflow Manager. Find and run jobs.

At the point of retirement, you will no longer be able to create new configurable apps. In addition, apps built using Configurable Apps will no longer be accessible, so we strongly encourage you to begin the process of migrating them to ArcGIS Instant Apps. This transition not only ensures access to new capabilities within ArcGIS Instant Apps but also keeps you aligned with the latest enhancements in Esri web mapping and geospatial web applications. Below, you will find the outlined timelines and essential details: ArcGIS Configurable Apps in ArcGIS Enterprise: In September 2023, Configurable Apps was deprecated in ArcGIS Enterprise 11.1. The final version of ArcGIS Enterprise that will support the creation of apps using the remaining configurable app templates, as well as access to existing configurable apps in your organization, will be released in Q2 2025. Existing versions of ArcGIS Enterprise will continue to be supported in accordance with the ArcGIS Enterprise product lifecycle. ArcGIS Configurable Apps in ArcGIS Online: In June 2023, we announced the deprecation notice for ArcGIS Configurable Apps. The last version of ArcGIS Online that will enable you to create configurable apps and access existing configurable apps in your organization is the October 2025 ArcGIS Online update. ArcGIS Configurable Apps will be retired from ArcGIS Online in the Q1 2026 release. Introducing Instant Apps ArcGIS Configurable Apps was the first way to create web apps in ArcGIS Online and we\u2019ve seen amazing apps created by users to solve challenging problems. Over the years ArcGIS technologies have modernized, and ArcGIS Configurable Apps is built on the legacy ArcGIS JavaScript API 3.x, which will be retired in July 2024. As the underlying technology of ArcGIS Configurable Apps retires, ArcGIS Configurable Apps will also retire in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. To see when individual ArcGIS Configurable Apps templates will be retired, read the Esri support article. ArcGIS Instant Apps quickly transforms your maps into focused, interactive web apps through a collection of purpose-driven templates. Instant Apps leverages easy-to-use, built-in tools to showcase 2D and 3D data, display a gallery of content, and deliver local public information. You can encourage your audience to interact with features in your map such as attachments, charts, or time sliders. It is available in both ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise. ArcGIS Instant Apps is built on Esri\u2019s latest web mapping technology, ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript 4.0. Thus, it offers optimized performance and provides an extensive suite of capabilities, such as mobile responsiveness, smart mapping styles, accessibility improvements, and a wide variety of focus-driven templates you can quickly deploy. ArcGIS Instant Apps now includes most of the functionality of ArcGIS Configurable Apps, enabling a smooth transition for your deprecated apps.

    "content": "ArcGIS Blog Developers Nov 20, 2024 Introducing the Security and Authentication guide for developers By George Owen and Allan Laframboise Earlier this year we released a new Security and authentication developer guide. This article takes a look at what\u2019s inside the guide and at some of the key resources that will help you learn how to implement authentication for your applications. Who is it for? The new Security and authentication guide is an essential resource for all developers using ArcGIS technology to create custom applications. It is for any developer who has ArcGIS Location Platform, ArcGIS Online, or ArcGIS Enterprise. Setting up authentication is always a prerequisite for accessing ArcGIS resources, so regardless of whether you intend to use Location services, Spatial analysis services, the Portal service, or anything else, you\u2019ll be making a pit stop in the authentication guide. What\u2019s inside? The security and authentication guide contains everything you need to know about authentication with ArcGIS, from the basic concepts to advanced implementations. The guide begins with Introduction to security and authentication, a page that explains the fundamentals of what authentication is and why it\u2019s required in your applications. The Types of authentication and How to use authentication pages expand on the introduction, laying the foundation for the rest of the guide to come. Types of authentication Authentication with ArcGIS can take several different forms depending on the type of authentication you choose to use. The guide includes a chapter for each of the supported types of authentication: API key authentication User authentication App authentication Each chapter explains how to implement one type of authentication to access secure resources in ArcGIS. They also cover best practices related for implementing each type of authentication. Tutorials for developer tools In the guide you\u2019ll also find a number of tutorials that explain how to use developer tools to help you implement authentication. For example, you\u2019ll learn how to use the developer credential creator in your ArcGIS portal to create API key credentials and OAuth 2.0 credentials for your apps. If you are ready to jump in, check out the tutorials related to API key authentication: Create an API key Migrate API keys (legacy) to API key credentials Manage API key credentials Rotate API keys For a deeper dive, you can also learn how to create OAuth 2.0 credentials to set up user authentication and app authentication: Create OAuth credentials for user authentication Create OAuth credentials for app authentication Workflows for every authentication method In addition to tutorials for developer tools, the guide explains how authentication works on a technical level. In particular, the user authentication chapter provides a deep dive into how OAuth 2.0 user authentication works with ArcGIS. The user authentication flows section expands on this, explaining every supported workflow for user authentication in a dedicated page. For example, the commonly used Authorization code flow with PKCE has its own page that documents its OAuth 2.0 flow diagram and implementation details with ArcGIS. Similarly to user authentication, the app authentication chapter explains the Client credentials flow with detailed implementation steps. It also includes links to Code examples hosted on GitHub. \u2026And more! A few additional pages round out the rest of the guide, including detailed Best practices and FAQ pages that answer many common questions about authentication. The reference chapter also includes essential pages such as Privileges and REST authentication operations that you may find useful during development. Ready to get started? If you are ready to started, go to the Get started section of the Security and authentication guide, learn about the types of authentication, and start implementing authentication in your apps. Once you implement authentication, you\u2019ll be able to access many other services and resources offered by Esri, including location services, the portal service, spatial analysis services, and more. We want your feedback! Please take our survey to let us know if the guide was helpful and how we can improve it.

These templates come with several components, including a QuickCapture project, layers, views, web maps, and dashboards. When you deploy a project from one of these templates, all associated items are automatically linked together. This makes it easy to capture data and then view the results in the connected web map or dashboard. How to Use a Solution-Based Template: 1. In the QuickCapture Web Designer, choose Create a New Project.2. Select the option Start from template.3. Browse through the available templates. Clicking on any template will display more details before you proceed with deployment. Deployment Process: - Once you deploy a solution-based template, a new directory will be created in your content. This directory will include all the related items (QuickCapture project, layers, web maps, and dashboards). The directory name will be based on the original template (e.g., `TemplateName`) If you deploy the same template multiple times, the folder name will be incremented (e.g., `TemplateName_2`, `TemplateName_3`, etc.). On completion, you can open the deployed project in the QuickCapture web designer, edit it, and share it with mobile users (ready for capturing data in the field). Solution-based templates are a great starting point. You can either use them as-is or modify them to fit your specific needs. However, note that you cannot create your own solution-based templates, but you can create Project-based templates. Project-Based Templates Project-based templates are hosted within organization and are created and shared by you (not Esri). These templates include the project, views and layers, but unlike solution-based templates, they do not include web maps or dashboards. How to Create a Project-Based Template: 1. In the QuickCapture Web designer create a project using the Create a New Project option using either:- Start with feature layers.- Start with an existing template. 2. Alternatively, use the Save As function to create a copy of an existing project. (Note: Save As works for layers you own or layers that have been shared with you.) 3. Once you\u2019ve created the desired project, organize your project and layers:- Create a group in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise (e.g., \"QuickCapture Templates\").- Share your project and layers with this group.- Ensure the project and layers are shared with your organization so everyone has access to them. Sharing Templates with Your Organization: - As an Administrator, log in to the QuickCapture Web Designer.- Go to Organization Settings and under the Templates section, select the group you created from the drop-down list.- You can choose to uncheck the option to include Esri templates, so only your organization\u2019s custom templates are available.

Too often, the top portion of a paper field data collection form asks the mobile worker a series of questions to describe where they are located. These questions ask for imprecise location descriptions such as state name, county name, city name, service area, construction project area, street name, and property number. None of these vague location descriptors will provide the follow-on mobile workers with the precise understanding of where the buried wire or pipe is located on the property to allow them to quickly locate these assets. To solve this location accuracy issue, most paper forms ask the mobile worker to draw a sketch in addition to answering those vague location descriptor questions previously mentioned. These \u201cdumb\u201d paper forms require more than conversion to digital; they need conversion to location-aware smart forms. Unfortunately, too many IT teams miss this opportunity to improve mobile worker efficiency by automatically populating these location questions. They miss the opportunity to lower Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs by eliminating the need for mobile workers to draw a sketch. Instead, they simply convert the questions on paper into digital form. When this \u201cdumb\u201d digital form is deployed to the mobile workforce, the mobile worker does not benefit. Often, they get frustrated and ask this simple question: If my mobile device knows where I am, why doesn\u2019t the digital form? Location Aware Today\u2019s mobile phones, tablets, and even laptops know their location. Many have built-in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) chips. Others use cell phone triangulation or wi-fi network node location. These mobile devices can put a blue dot on the map to show the mobile worker where they are located. Where am I? The simple question of \u201cWhere am I?\u201d is at the heart of location-aware smart forms. Leveraging the device\u2019s understanding of location is a great first step in eliminating vague location questions. Remember that even the cheap GNSS receiver card in today\u2019s mobile phones provides a more accurate location definition than a street address. According to Apple documentation, an iPhone 15 GNSS card has an average spatial accuracy of +/- 10 meters. That translates to a search area of 314 sq meters. A quick Google search for the average square footage of suburban single-family lot returns an estimate of 1300 sq meters. Doing some quick math shows that using the mobile device GNSS card to identify location results in a 75% reduction in the search area to locate the buried utility. Knowing where you are, can be refined further by providing an interactive map with a basemap. Then allow the mobile worker to move the blue dot location to a new location based on the basemap. This will improve the spatial accuracy of your location, further reducing the potential search area for the buried utility. What Area am I in? With the location now defined, a location-aware smart form such are ArcGIS Field Maps ca",
    "summary": "This blog post discusses how to create location-aware smart forms for field data collection using ArcGIS Field Maps. Traditional paper forms struggle to define precise locations, requiring field workers to answer vague location questions and draw sketches. Converting these to digital forms without leveraging the mobile device's built-in location capabilities misses an opportunity to improve efficiency. Location-aware smart forms can auto-populate location fields, identify what area the worker is in, and determine nearby features of interest. This improves productivity by reducing time spent on paperwork.

Until the ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 releases, the supported automation patterns for this included ArcGIS Data Pipelines and scheduled Notebooks or tools using the REST API task scheduler, but a new no-code option, web tool scheduling, is delivered in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4! You can use any type of geoprocessing tool to create your scheduled web tool - core system tool, ModelBuilder tool, Python script tool or Spatial ETL tool. For my blog subject matter I'm using an ArcGIS Data Interoperability Spatial ETL tool, because it can consume my source data, an RSS feed, specifically a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) feed, as published by many agencies worldwide, including FEMA in the USA. My CAP data is weather alerts in New Zealand, refreshed twice daily. The feed will have no entries if the weather is good . CAP is XML-based, easily handled by ArcGIS Data Interoperability. I want to mirror the CAP feed status to a hosted feature layer in ArcGIS Online. Below is a sample alert status map in ArcGIS Pro, for October 9th 2024. The blog download has a couple of CAP alert XML documents, if you want to see some raw data. CAP Weather Alerts As the labeling suggests, the yellow feature is a high wind watch, the blue lines (zoomed in, orange polygons) are snow warnings for roads through some mountain passes. If we zoom in to the northernmost feature we can inspect it. It is Lewis Pass, which has two geothermal spring resorts along the route, so if you do get delayed by snow you can wait it out in comfort! Snow alert through Lewis Pass A few days later, there is a heavy rain watch: Fiordland rain watch For the area, rain only comes in one type - heavy - so it's no surprise the prediction of an alert upgrade from watch to warning (orange) became true at the next update in 12 hours, plus some new alerts arrived: West Coast rain And the next day - yet more weather! Yet more weather! Regular updates like this are a classic case for a scheduled web tool, in fact that's how the data was refreshed for me overnight. What does that ETL look like? My data flow maintains a hosted feature layer in ArcGIS Online from the current CAP status. My ETL tool is quite simple, here it is (also in the blog download, requires ArcGIS Data Interoperability for Pro 3.4, and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 if shared as a web tool). CAP alert ETL tool First a token is generated (using an EsriOnlineTokengetter, for a local portal you would use an EsriPortalTokenGetter), then the upper stream reads the RSS feed and writes an upsert transaction to the target feature layer - any new alerts become new features and any data changes to existing features are applied.

    "summary": "This blog post introduces a new feature in ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 that allows scheduling of geoprocessing web tools, including Spatial ETL tools from ArcGIS Data Interoperability. The author demonstrates this capability by creating an ETL tool that reads weather alerts from a CAP RSS feed and updates a hosted feature layer in ArcGIS Online on a scheduled basis. The ETL tool generates a portal token to read and write the feature service without needing to share web connections. This provides a no-code option for automating data updates and ETL workflows.",
    "interestScore": 7,
    "rationale": "I assigned an interest score of 7 because this post introduces a useful new capability for automating ETL and data updates using scheduled web tools, which was previously only possible through other methods like ArcGIS Data Pipelines or the REST API. The ability to schedule any type of geoprocessing tool, including Spatial ETL tools, provides a lot of flexibility. The post also demonstrates a recommended new ETL pattern of generating portal tokens within the tool. However, the post is a bit niche in focusing specifically on CAP weather alerts, so it may not have broad appeal to all audiences.",

Select to view content in your preferred language Translate Now Seven handy tips for getting started creating a custom dictionary style Subscribe 943 8 11-13-2024 12:13 PM Labels (2) Labels Defense Intel by megan_r Esri Contributor 3 8 943 Subscribe to RSS Feed Mark as New Mark as Read Bookmark Subscribe Printer Friendly Page \u200e11-13-2024 12:13 PM Dictionary styles provide a highly customizable way to visualize attribute-rich data in your maps and applications. With a look-up table of individual symbol parts, a dictionary script connecting attribute values to symbol keys, and a configuration file for fine tuning, these styles can be used together with the Dictionary Renderer to build complex symbols driven by multiple attributes in your data. I created a dictionary style for the Alternative Fuel Stations layer in Living Atlas that provides information about each station at a quick glance. In this blog, I will share some of my top tips for creating your own custom dictionary style while we take a closer look at the one I created. If you want to explore the style as you read, here are links to the style and a web map where a layer has already been configured with the style. Tip 1 \u2013 Gather resources to use while building your style Whenever I start building a new dictionary style, I am prepared with my favorite resources at hand. First is this blog by my colleague Thad: Create custom dictionary styles for ArcGIS. The blog shares all the tools and steps needed to build your style from start to finish. My go-to tools are: DB Browser for SQLite, Visual Studio Code, ArcGIS Pro, and A subset of the data to test the style along the way. The Custom Dictionary Style Guide is another great place to get started with in-depth, step-by-step instructions for creating your own custom style. I also like to have the dictionary renderer toolkit handy. The toolkit is full of resources for understanding, creating, and troubleshooting dictionary styles, as well as a few sample styles worth exploring. Tip 2 \u2013 Don't forget about built-in default symbol keys Each individual symbol part has a unique key defined in the look-up table. The best way to create and edit these symbol parts is in ArcGIS Pro. First add the style to your project Catalog then double-click the Alternative Fuel Stations style to open the table. Here you will find all the symbol parts in the style. Let\u2019s focus on the Fuel Type symbols first. There are 7 fuel type symbols and one default symbol (we will get to that one in a moment), each with their own unique key. With exception of the default key, these keys follow the format \u201cfuel-\u201d followed by the fuel type abbreviation found in the Fuel_Type field. The dictionary script is an Arcade script that contains instructions on how to use attribute values to build symbol keys. The dictionary script uses $feature.Fuel_Type to produce the fuel type key. This is the first key listed, so when a feature is evaluated, the type key is the first one returned. But what happens when Fuel_Type is empty or the full name, \u201cElectric\u201d is used instead of \u201cELEC\u201d? In these hypothetical cases, the script would return \u201cfuel-\u201d and \u201cfuel-Electric\u201d, two keys that do not exist in the look-up table. This is where the default symbol comes in! Dictionary renderers have built-in default symbol keys that a",
    "summary": "This blog post provides seven helpful tips for creating custom dictionary styles in ArcGIS. The tips cover gathering resources like documentation and tools, leveraging default symbol keys, using primitive overrides to vary symbol properties, taking advantage of configuration properties to customize the style, choosing between symbol and text fields for labels, using unique primitive names for overrides, and returning keys in the proper drawing order. The author walks through an example custom dictionary style they created for an alternative fuel stations layer to illustrate the concepts.",
    "interestScore": 7,
    "rationale": "I assigned an interest score of 7 because the blog post focuses heavily on technical details and developer tools for creating custom dictionary styles and renderers. This falls under the \"Developer tools and APIs\" criteria which is considered high value. The post dives deep into the mechanics of building these styles which would be very useful for a developer audience. However, it doesn't cover broader platform changes, major new features, or product announcements that would warrant an even higher score.",
