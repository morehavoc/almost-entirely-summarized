# Recent Esri Blog Highlights

## Introduction

This summary highlights the key themes, trends, and significant updates from recent Esri blog posts covering a range of GIS technologies and products. The posts discuss enhancements in 3D visualization, indoor mapping, oriented imagery, web app development, and more.

## Key Themes and Trends

A major focus across these updates is the expansion of 3D capabilities, with new features for visualizing, editing, and sharing 3D data introduced in ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS CityEngine, and other products. Indoor mapping also sees significant improvements, particularly in ArcGIS Indoors and ArcGIS IPS. Oriented imagery gains support for 360-degree images and deep learning object detection.

Productivity and ease-of-use enhancements are another common theme, with simplified interfaces, new templates, and improved integration across the ArcGIS platform. ModelBuilder enters public beta, promising a visual, no-code environment for building analysis workflows.
